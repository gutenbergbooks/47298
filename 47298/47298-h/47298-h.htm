<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>

<p>Book <span class="smcap">X.</span> relates how Gawain, after various adventures, fell in with a
maiden and a wounded knight, how he succoured the knight and rode to
Logrois. How he met with Orgelus&eacute; and wooed her, and how she repaid
him with scorn. How the squire Malcr&eacute;ature mocked Sir Gawain, and
how the knight Urian stole his charger. How Lischois Giwellius fought
with Gawain and was conquered, and of the tribute due to the Master
Boatman. How Gawain came to Terre de Merveil, and was well entreated
by the Boatman and his daughter Ben&eacute;.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now tell we of strange adventures thro' which joy shall be waxen low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet pride shall grow the greater, of the twain doth this story show.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now the year of truce was ended, when the strife must needs be fought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which the Landgrave unto King Arthur at Plimiz&ouml;l had brought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Schamfanzon he challenged Gawain to meet him at Barbig&ouml;l,                           <span class="linenum">5</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet still unavenged was Kingrisein at the hand of Kingrimursel&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sooth, Vergulacht, he rode there, and thither had come Gawain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the whole world was 'ware of their kinship nor might strife be betwixt the twain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the murder, Count Eckun&acirc;t did it, and Gawain must they guiltless hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At rest did they lay their quarrel and friends were those heroes bold.                <span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then they parted for both would ride thence, Vergulacht and the knight Gawain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho' both for the Grail were seeking yet apart would they ride, those twain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a joust must they ride now, for he who the Grail would see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sword in hand must he draw anigh it, and swift must his seeking be!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now all that befell to Gawain, the lot of that blameless knight                       <span class="linenum">15</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since he rode forth from fair Schamfanzon, if he oft on his way must fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye shall ask of those who there saw him, since naught may I tell ye here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet hearken, and heed the story and the venture that draweth near.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
<span class="i0">One morning Gawain rode gaily o'er a grassy plain and green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When a shield, in the sun fair shining, with lance-thrust pierced thro' was seen,     <span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a charger stood beside it that bare women's riding-gear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bridle and aye the housing were of costly stuff and dear&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the charger and shield beside it were bound to a linden tree.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he thought, 'Who shall be this woman? for valiant I ween is she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since she beareth a shield so knightly&mdash;If she thinketh with me to fight,             <span class="linenum">25</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">How, then, may I best withstand her? Were it better to here alight?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If too long she wrestle with me perchance I were overthrown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If hatred or love I shall win here I will fight her on foot alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, e'en an she were Kamilla, who before Laurentium fought&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did she live still to battle with me, as awhile she for honour sought,                <span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would face her, nor fear her prowess, if here she my foe would be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho' ne'er with a maid have I foughten and the chance seemeth ill to me!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Battle-hewn was the shield and dinted, as Gawain right well espied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nearer he rode unto it, and pierced with a lance-thrust wide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such token by joust is painted, little payment his skill should know                  <span class="linenum">35</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose hand erst the shield had fashioned an he thought him to paint it so!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the trunk of the mighty linden sat a maid on the grass so green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sore did she weep and bewail her, and joyless, I wot, her mien.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then around the tree rode Gawain, and lo! on her knee she bore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A knight, and she wept above him, and grieved with a sorrow sore.                     <span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fair greeting Sir Gawain proffered, she thanked him and bowed her low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hoarse was her voice thro' weeping and weakened thro' force of woe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then down to the ground sprang Gawain, for the knight he was like to choke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since the blood welled within his body, and unto the maid he spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he asked if the knight were living, or should now in the death-throe be?          <span class="linenum">45</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she spake, 'He dieth surely, yet but now alive was he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God hath sent thee unto my succour, now help me with word and deed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such wounds shalt thou oft have looked on, give counsel in this my need!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Yea, gladly I'll aid thee, Lady, from death shall thy knight be freed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And healing I well might win him an there were but at hand a reed.                    <span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt see him, and hearken to him, nor his life shall be waxen less,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wound is not all too dangerous, but the blood on his heart doth press.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he stripped from a bough of the linden the bark, and did wind it round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(No fool he in art of healing,) and he set it unto the wound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he bade the maiden suck it till the blood should toward her flow&mdash;                <span class="linenum">55</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strength came again and hearing, and the voice of the knight they know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he looked on Gawain, and he thanked him, and said he should honoured be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that from his woe he had freed him, and he asked of him, whence came he?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rode he hither in search of knighthood? 'From far Punturtois I came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In search of such knightly venture as should win for me meed of fame,                 <span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet sorely must I bewail me for the ill that I here have won,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sir Knight, an thy senses fail not, 'twere better this way to shun!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Such evil I little looked for&mdash;'Twas Lischois Giwellius<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who hath wounded me so sorely, and down from my charger thrust:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair was the joust and knightly, and he pierced me thro' shield and side,             <span class="linenum">65</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">On her steed this maiden helped me, and hither hath been my guide!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he prayed Gawain to abide there, but he spake, he the place would see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where such evil had chanced unto him, 'If Logrois thus near shall be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perchance I shall yet o'ertake him, he shall answer to me, I trow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the deed he hath done, and his reason for vengeance on thee I'll know!'           <span class="linenum">70</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the wounded knight spake, 'Not so, for true are the words I say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no child's play shall be this journey, great perils beset the way.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With the band from the maiden's tresses Gawain the wound did bind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spake o'er it spells of healing, and he bade them their comfort find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In God, since He cares for all men&mdash;With blood was their pathway red,                 <span class="linenum">75</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crimson the grass besprinkled as a stag had its life-blood shed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus he rode not astray, and in short space did Logrois before him stand&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fortress so fair and stately, its praise was in every land.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Twas a stately Burg well builded, and it wound the hillside round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From afar as a mighty circlet the fortress the summit crowned.                        <span class="linenum">80</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'en to-day men this honour give it, its wall shall be stormed in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For it openeth its gates to no foeman, whose hatred soe'er it gain!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And a garden lay green around it, 'twas planted with trees so fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Olive, pomegranate, fig-tree, and the vine which its grapes doth bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gaily they grew and flourished&mdash;as Gawain rode that garden bright                   <span class="linenum">85</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw there what wrought him sorrow, yet filled him with all delight!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A streamlet gushed forth from the hillside, there he saw that which grieved him naught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lady so fair to look on that gladly her face he sought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flower was she of all women, save Kondwiramur alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No fairer form nor feature might ever on earth be known.                                <span class="linenum">90</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So sweet and so bright to look on, so courteous and royal of mien,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Orgelus&eacute;, was she, of Logrois, and men say that in her was seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The charm that desire awakeneth, a balm for the eyes of care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For no heart but was drawn toward her, and no mouth but would speak her fair!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Gawain gave her courteous greeting, and he spake, 'If such grace I &#291;ain<span class="linenum">95</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou willest I should alight here and awhile at thy side remain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I see that my presence please thee, then sorrow be far from me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And joy in its stead dwell with me, no knight e'er might gladder be!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May I die if the truth I speak not, no woman e'er pleased me more&mdash;'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'It is well, yet methinks I knew that,' then the knight for a space she saw;           <span class="linenum">100</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And her sweet lips spake thus unto him, 'Now make of thy praise an end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For well might it work thee evil, and I care not that foe or friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whoever he be that cometh, his judgment on me shall speak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For sure if all lips shall praise me my fame it but waxeth weak!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If the wise praise me e'en as the foolish, the false as the pure and true,             <span class="linenum">105</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then my fame shall be e'en as another's, for the many shall drown the few.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But my praise do I hold, and but wisdom shall speak that which she doth know&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who thou mayst be, Sir Knight, I know not, but 'tis time thou thy way shouldst go!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Yet o'er thee will I speak my verdict, if thou dwellest anear my heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then thy dwelling is not <i>within</i> it, for <i>without</i> shalt thou have thy part.    <span class="linenum">110</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And say thou my love desirest, how hast thou rewarding won?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the eyes swiftly shoot the glances, yet a sling, when the work is done,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Smiteth gentler than looks which linger on that which doth sorrow wreak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy desire is but empty folly, thou shouldst other service seek!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thine hand for love's sake shall battle, if adventure hath bidden thee             <span class="linenum">115</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">By knighthood win love's rewarding, yet thou winnest it not from <i>me</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor honour shall be thy portion, but shame shalt thou win alone&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now the truth have I spoken unto thee, 'twere best thou shouldst get thee gone!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he quoth, 'Truth thou speakest, Lady, since mine eyes thus mine heart have brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In danger, for <i>they</i> beheld thee, and thy fetters around me wrought.                 <span class="linenum">120</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now, since I be thy captive, I prithee entreat me well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without thine own will hast thou done this, in silence I owned thy spell:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt loose me, or thou shalt bind me, for my will it shall be as thine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gladly all woes I'ld suffer if so I might call thee mine!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then she quoth, 'Yea! so take me with thee, if thou countest upon thy gain,           <span class="linenum">125</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the love that shall be thy guerdon, thou shalt mourn it in shame and pain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I would know if a man thou shalt be who bravely for me would fight&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet, if thou prize thine honour, thou wilt flee from this strife, Sir Knight!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And should I yet further rede thee, and thou shouldst to my word say yea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then seek thou elsewhere a lady&mdash;For, if thou my love dost pray,                      <span class="linenum">130</span><br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then answered Gawain, 'Without service, who thinketh true love to win?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An one did so, then here I tell thee, 'twere counted to him for sin,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then she quoth, 'Wilt thou do me service? shame waiteth for thee in store,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho' thy life be a life of conflict&mdash;No coward as my knight I'll own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See thou yonder path, 'tis no highway, o'er the bridge doth it wend adown<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Many folk shalt thou see and shalt hearken, but take thou of their words no heed,     <span class="linenum">140</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor stay for their dance or singing, for tambour, or harp, or flute,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But go thou to my horse, and loose it, that I go not with thee afoot!'<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Gawain sprang from off his charger&mdash;Yet awhile he bethought him well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where his steed might abide his coming: by the waters that rippling fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was no tree unto which to bind it, and he knew not if he this dame                    <span class="linenum">145</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might pray, would she hold his charger till once more with her own he came.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then she quoth, 'I see well what doth vex thee, thine horse shalt thou leave with me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will guard it until thy coming tho' small good shall that be to thee!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Gawain took his horse's bridle, 'Now hold this for me, I pray;'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Now indeed art thou dull and foolish,' spake the lady, 'where <i>thou</i> dost lay   <span class="linenum">150</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thine hand, thinkest thou <i>I'll</i> hold it? such deed would beseem me ill!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the love-lorn knight spake gently, for fain would he do her will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Further forward I never hold it!' Then she quoth, '<i>I</i> will hold it there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And do thou my bidding swiftly, bring my steed and with thee I'll fare;'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he thought this a joyful hearing, and straightway he left her side,              <span class="linenum">155</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over the bridge so narrow to the garden gate he hied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There saw he many a maiden, and knights so brave and young,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And within that goodly garden so gaily they danced and sung.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And Gawain he was clad so richly, with helmet and harness fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all must bewail his coming for naught but true folk dwelt there.                 <span class="linenum">160</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">They cared for that lovely garden, on the greensward they stood or lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or sat 'neath the tents whose shadow was cool 'gainst the sunlight's ray.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet they ceased not to bemoan him, and to grieve for his sorrow sore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, man alike and maiden, and in this wise their plaint they bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Alas! that our lady's cunning will to danger this knight betray!                     <span class="linenum">165</span><br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And many stepped fair towards him, and their arms around him threw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bade him a friendly greeting&mdash;to an olive tree he drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the steed was fast beneath it, so rich was its gear, I ween,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the cost of the goodly trappings full thousand marks had been.                   <span class="linenum">170</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And an old knight he stood beside it, well-trimmed was his beard and grey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And upon a staff he leant him, and salt tears he wept alway.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the tears, they were shed for Gawain, as he to the steed drew near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet his words of kindly greeting fell soft on the hero's ear.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then he spake, 'Wilt thou hearken counsel? Lay not on this steed thine hand,          <span class="linenum">175</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And herein shalt thou show thy wisdom&mdash;tho' none here thy will withstand,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yet Gawain he would do her bidding&mdash;'Then, alas! for woe draweth near,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spake the knight, and he loosed the halter, ''Twere best not to linger here,          <span class="linenum">180</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The steed shalt thou take, and shalt leave us, and may He Who made salt the sea,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And see thou that our lady's beauty, it bringeth thee not to shame,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Of the old knight and of his comrades and sorely the folk did grieve.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the horse went a narrow pathway, and it passed thro' the garden gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it crossed o'er the bridge, and he found her who there did his coming wait,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The queen of his heart, and the ruler was she of that land so fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet altho' his heart fled towards her yet grief thro' her deed it bare.               <span class="linenum">190</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her hand 'neath her chin soft-rounded had loosened the wimple's fold,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As Gawain drew near the lady, she hailed him with scornful mien,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Now welcome, thou goose! for of all men most foolish art thou, I ween,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All too bent shalt thou be on my service, wert thou wise thou wouldst let it be&mdash;'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he quoth, 'Yet shalt thou be gracious who now art so wroth with me,              <span class="linenum">200</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For so harshly thou dost chastise me thou in honour must make it good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my hand shall be fain to serve thee till thou winnest a milder mood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ask thou what of me thou willest&mdash;Shall I lift thee upon thy steed?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she quoth, 'I will no such service, for methinks all too great such meed<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For a hand that is yet unproven&mdash;Ask thou for a lesser grace!'                        <span class="linenum">205</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the flowery sward she turned her, and she looked not on Gawain's face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she laid her hand on the bridle, and she light to the saddle sprung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she bade him to ride before her, and she spake with a mocking tongue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Now indeed would it be great pity did I stray from so brave a knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By God's grace will we keep together, so ride thou within my sight!'                  <span class="linenum">210</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now he who my rede would follow his peace shall he hold awhile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest he speak but the word of folly, till he know if she wrought of guile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For as yet the truth ye know not, nor the thing that was in her heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And were it the time for vengeance, then I too might bear my part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And take from this lady payment for the wrong she hath done Gawain;                   <span class="linenum">215</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor of that she shall do hereafter shall aught unavenged remain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Orgelus&eacute;, that lovely lady, bare herself in no friendly wise,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That were I in the stead of Gawain little comfort my soul might take<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That she from my care would free me, and with fair love atonement make.               <span class="linenum">220</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they rode on an open moorland, and a herb did Sir Gawain see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose root had the power of healing, and down to the ground sprang he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dug up the root, and swiftly he sprang on his steed again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the lady she looked upon him, and she spake in a mocking vein,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Now in sooth if this my companion can at one-while be leech and knight,              <span class="linenum">225</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For starvation he need not fear him if his salve-box he bear aright!'<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Methinks, if again I find him, this herb shall the poison draw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his wounds, and new strength may give him!' She spake, 'Now I well were fain<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now a squire he rode swift behind them, 'twas the lady's messenger,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Gawain would await his coming, and his steed for a space he held,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet he deemed him he saw a monster when first he the squire beheld,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Malcr&eacute;ature did they call him, and Kondrie was his sister fair,                  <span class="linenum">235</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now Adam, of all men father, from God did he learn such skill,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the power of the seven planets, how they rule men from heaven high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he knew of all roots the virtue, and the ill that was theirs of yore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When his children were grown to manhood, and daughters and sons they bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From evil desires he warned them; and his daughters he oft did rede<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of certain roots to beware them, that wrought ill with the human seed,                <span class="linenum">250</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And would change their face, and their aspect, and dishonoured the race should be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he spake, 'Then shall we be other than erst God did fashion me,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And they wrought out the lust and the evil on which their desire was bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the shape of men was chang&egrave;d, such rewarding their fault must win,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tho' firm stood the will of Adam yet sorely he mourned their sin&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now the fair Queen Sekundill&eacute;, her body, her crown, and land,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now this son of the herbs and the planets loud mocked at the gallant knight,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With that by the hair he gripped him, and he swung him from off his horse,            <span class="linenum">295</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The squire glared wrathful on him, and his bristles, so sharp and coarse,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then the twain to their feet upspringing their swords from the scabbard drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since alike they were keen for combat, and their shields in pieces flew,              <span class="linenum">550</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For each hewed at the shield of the other till a hand's breadth alone, I ween,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They held, for the pledge of conflict the shield it hath ever been.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Flashed the sword-blades, fire sprang from the helmets, a venture brave I trow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was his who should here be victor, tho' stern conflict he first must know.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long space did they fight, those heroes, on the flowery meadow wide,                  <span class="linenum">555</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as smiths, who all day have laboured, as it weareth to eventide<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Grow faint with their toil and weary with the mighty blows they smite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So weary and faint were those heroes who here did for honour fight.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But for this none methinks shall praise them, unwise do I hold the twain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No cause had they here for battle, 'twas fame that they thought to gain;              <span class="linenum">560</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strangers unto each other, each other's life they sought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet, had they made confession, each owed to the other naught!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now Gawain was a gallant wrestler, and his foe to the ground would bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If in spite of the sword he might grip him, and let but the mighty ring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his arms his foeman circle, he forced him where'er he would.                       <span class="linenum">565</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now must he with force defend him, and he fought as a hero good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his courage waxed ever higher, and the youth in his arms he caught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he bare him to earth beneath him tho' e'en as a man he fought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he quoth, 'Wilt thou live, thou hero, thou must yield thee unto mine hand!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet Lischois, he was all unready to follow so stern command;                          <span class="linenum">570</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For never his pledge had he given, and he deemed it a wondrous thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the hand of a knight should o'erthrow him, and him in such peril bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That against his will he must yield him, who had ever the victor been,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in sooth full many a combat his foeman o'erthrown had seen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full oft he from them had taken what he cared not to give again,                      <span class="linenum">575</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, rather his life would he forfeit; and he spake unto knight Gawain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he said, 'Let what would befall him, his pledge to no man he'd give;'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, death would he rather suffer, since no longer he cared to live!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then sadly, he spake, the vanquished, 'Thou hero, is victory thine?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So long as God bare me favour such honour was ever mine;                              <span class="linenum">580</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now hath my fame an ending, and thy right hand hath laid me low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if maiden and man must hearken to the tale of my overthrow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose glory once rose to the heaven, then death shall my portion be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere my kinsmen shall hear the story, and shall sorrow and mourn for me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet Gawain still prayed him yield him, but his will and his mind were so              <span class="linenum">585</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he prayed God would rather take him, or slay him by this his foe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thought Gawain, 'I am loth to kill him, if he swear but to do my will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unharmed he may go'&mdash;yet the young knight withheld him his promise still.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then, ere he his hand had given, the hero he bade him rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the flowery mead they sat them: then Gawain he bethought him wise,                 <span class="linenum">590</span><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
<span class="i0">(For his sorry steed it vexed him) the horse of his vanquished foe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With spur and with rein would he test there, if 'twere good for his need or no.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">('Twas armed as beseemed a warhorse, and the covering was fair to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of velvet and silk was it fashioned, what trapping might better be?)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since the venture such prize had brought him, who should hinder him in his need       <span class="linenum">595</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">If for his own use he took it? so he vaulted upon the steed:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And he joyed in the free, swift movement, and he cried, 'Now, how shall this be?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a sooth it is thou, Gringuljet, that false Urian stole from me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>He</i> knoweth best how he took it, and shameful I count his deed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, who thus for battle armed thee, since thou art of a truth my steed?              <span class="linenum">600</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sure 'tis God who hath sent thee to me, and this fair gift shall end my woe.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he sprang to the ground, and he sought him the token he well might know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On its shoulder the Grail-Dove branded&mdash;In a joust did L&auml;helein slay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its rider, the knight of Prienlaskors, and the charger he bare away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Orilus was its master, and he gave it to knight Gawain                           <span class="linenum">605</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Plimiz&ouml;l's shore&mdash;greatly joyed he when the charger he won again.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Blithe was he, and high of courage, who awhile was sad and sore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet love unto ruth constrained him, and the service so true he bore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the lady who yet would shame him, and his thoughts ever toward her flew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then up sprang proud Lischois lightly, and his good sword he gripped anew,            <span class="linenum">610</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For it lay where Gawain had cast it when he wrested it from his hand:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the ladies look down on the heroes, as for combat once more they stand.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The shields were so hacked and riven that the knights they must cast them by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, shieldless, to strife betake them, and they bare them right gallantly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a crowd of fair maidens o'er them from the palace window saw                      <span class="linenum">615</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strife that below was foughten: and fierce anger awoke once more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For too nobly born I wot me was each man that he might brook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That his fame should be lightly yielded, and maids on his shaming look.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And helmet and sword were smitten, for shields 'gainst cold death were they,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He who saw the heroes strive there had mourned for their toil that day.               <span class="linenum">620</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lischois Giwellius bare him, that fair youth, as knight so brave,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
<span class="i0">True courage, and deeds undaunted, the counsel his high heart gave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a swift blow dealt he, as quick on Gawain he sprung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lightly avoided from him, and his blade round his head he swung.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Gawain stood firm and undaunted, and he thought him, 'Now, let me hold            <span class="linenum">625</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thee once in mine arms, I'll repay thee thy dealings, thou hero bold!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And fiery sparks might ye look on, and the flash of the glittering blade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well wielded by hand of hero&mdash;Nor one in his station stayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they pressed each one on the other, backward, forward, to either side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet this conflict so fierce, I wot me, did ne'er of revenge betide,                   <span class="linenum">630</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no hatred they bare to each other&mdash;Then the arms of Gawain at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He clasped round his gallant foeman, and the knight to the ground he cast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I think, an I friendship sware here, I would shrink from such fond embrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'en tho' brotherhood it were sealing&mdash;Nor with ye would such clasp find grace!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Gawain he bade him yield him, yet Lischois, who against his will                 <span class="linenum">635</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had striven when first he felled him, was all unready still.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he quoth, 'Wherefore thus delay thee, 'tis needless, take thou my life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For better to die than to yield me&mdash;Since I wot well that in this strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fame that was mine aforetime hath vanished beneath thy blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of God must I be accurs&egrave;d, since my glory such goal doth know!                       <span class="linenum">640</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the love of fair Orgelus&eacute; have I served her with knightly hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a knight have I felled here, for none might my arm withstand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now shalt thou be heir to my glory, for it falleth to thee of right<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou, who my fame hath ended, here endeth my life, Sir Knight.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But King Lot's son he thought in this wise, 'To this deed have I little mind,         <span class="linenum">645</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">My name, it shall gain small honour if this man here his death shall find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If for no sin of his I slay him, who is true and valiant knight&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas <i>her</i> love that spurred him 'gainst me, for whose favour I too would fight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis her beauty that doth constrain me, 'tis she that doth work me woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then why not, for the sake of my lady, show mercy to this my foe?                     <span class="linenum">650</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">If perchance for mine own I win her, if mine own such bliss may be,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And if o'er our strife she watcheth, then she must of a surety own<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I, who for love would serve her, true service and good have shown!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then out spake the gallant Gawain, 'I were loth thy life to take,                     <span class="linenum">655</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But hence will I let thee, scatheless, for fair Orgelus&eacute;'s sake!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Weary were they, small wonder, then the fallen knight arose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And down on the grassy meadow apart sat those gallant foes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the master boatman stepped forth from the water unto the land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a grey and yearling falcon he carried upon his hand.                              <span class="linenum">660</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">This right was his o'er the meadow, who jousted upon the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The charger of him who was vanquished he did as his tribute gain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his hand, who was there the victor, should he take, as a gift, the steed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bowing, thank him fairly, nor stint of his praise the meed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And such payment he oft had taken on the flowery meadow green,                        <span class="linenum">665</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor otherwise had his living; save at whiles, when such chance had been,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That a bird in his falcon's clutches had fluttered in grief and pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor plough drave he thro' those furrows, for enough did he deem his gain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And son of a folk so knightly was he born to a knight's estate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And courteous, I ween, his bearing who there on Gawain did wait.                      <span class="linenum">670</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So came he unto the hero, and with courteous word and fair<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Quoth Gawain, the gallant hero, 'No merchant methinks I be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pay here or toll or tribute, from such tax do I hold me free!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he spake out, the master boatman, 'Sir Knight, since full many a maid            <span class="linenum">675</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">My right o'er the plain must thou own here, in knightly joust thine hand<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But now he of God is stricken, and his joy hath an ending found,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Afoot, and right sore 'twould grieve me if that charger were thine alway!             <span class="linenum">690</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For to-day in the early morning it was <i>mine</i> without doubt or fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And childish thou art if thou thinkest thus lightly to win it here!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas Duke Orilus, the Burgundian, who gave me the steed of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Urian stole this morning, and the tale thou for truth shalt hold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the foal of a mule shalt thou win thee ere thy prize be this steed of mine&mdash;      <span class="linenum">695</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then the guerdon is more than I asked for and o'er my deserts my meed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his praises they rang so clearly that five hundred steeds all told,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swift-footed and strong for battle, too low for his price I'ld hold!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If a rich man thou thus wilt make me, then this thing shalt thou do for me,           <span class="linenum">705</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">King Lot's son he spake in answer, 'Yea this will I do, and more,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When joy was from God my portion, for a heart did beneath it lie.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now I think me that heart hath vanished, and where shall I comfort seek?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall I helpless abide that Frau Minne her wrath upon me shall wreak?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, had she the heart of a woman she would give me my joy again                      <span class="linenum">725</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Perchance the truth thou knowst not? This land is a wonder-land,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And a seat like unto the other for the host he beside it made.                        <span class="linenum">760</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came another squire and he carried fresh linen the board to spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For thus gave the host commandment,) and he bare with the linen bread.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the hostess she followed after, and she looked well upon Gawain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she gave him a heartfelt greeting, and she spake, 'Now such grace we gain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From thine hand we are rich henceforward as we never have been before,                <span class="linenum">765</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sir Knight, sure our good luck waketh since such fortune it hither bore!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then when they had brought him water, and the host sat beside his guest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With courteous mien Sir Gawain this prayer to his host addrest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Now I pray let this maid eat with me,' 'Sir Knight, ne'er was she allowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sit with knights, or eat with them, lest she wax of their grace too proud.         <span class="linenum">770</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet so much do we owe thee, loth were I to say thee nay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, daughter, sit thou beside him, and as he shall speak obey!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then she blushed for shame all rosy, yet she did as her father bade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And down on the couch by Gawain sat Ben&eacute; the gracious maid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(And two stalwart sons had the boatman beside that maiden sweet)                      <span class="linenum">775</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three game-birds, I ween, that even were slain by the falcon fleet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all three did they bear unto Gawain, and a broth with herbs beside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the maiden she courteous served him as she sat by the hero's side;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For she carved for him dainty morsels, and laid them on bread so white<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her slender hands, and gently she spake to the stranger knight,                  <span class="linenum">780</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Wilt thou send a bird to my mother? for else hath she none, I ween.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then gladly he told the maiden his will e'en as hers had been<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In this thing as in all other&mdash;to the hostess the bird they bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they honoured the hand of the hero, nor the boatman his thanks would spare.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Purslain and lettuce brought they, in vinegar steeped, I ween                         <span class="linenum">785</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had he sought here his strength to nourish little good might such food have been;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if one should o'er-long feed on it then the colour it waxeth pale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such pallor as truth betrayeth, if the mouth to its speaking fail.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if with false red it be hidden, it fadeth, and bringeth shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she who is true and steadfast she winneth the higher fame.                        <span class="linenum">790</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If one by goodwill were nourished, then Gawain, he right well had fed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To her child naught the mother grudgeth, and as free gave the host his bread.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they bare away the tables, and the hostess she bade him rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bedding I ween in plenty they brought for the gallant guest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one was of down, and the covering above it of velvet green,                       <span class="linenum">795</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the velvet was none of the richest tho' fair had its fashion been.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a cushion must serve for cover, beneath it should Gawain lie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor the silk had with gold been purchased, 'twas won in far Araby.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of silk, too, the cunning stitching, and the linen was fair, and white<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As snow that they laid above it, and a pillow they brought the knight.                <span class="linenum">800</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a cloak of her own she lent him, for wrapping, that maiden fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas new, and of ermine fashioned, and such as a prince might wear.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then leave the host courteous prayed him ere he laid himself down to sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men say that alone with Sir Gawain the maiden her watch did keep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I think if he more had prayed her she never had said him Nay&mdash;                    <span class="linenum">805</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he slept, for he well might slumber, God keep him till dawn of day!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Weary he closed his eyelids, and he slept in a slumber deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the light of the early morning must waken him from his sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a window saw he within that chamber wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clear glass was before each window&mdash;Thro' a doorway the light did fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas open, without was an orchard, thither gat him the gallant knight                  <span class="linenum">5</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the air, and the song-birds' music, and to see what might meet his sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And but little space had he sat there, when the castle he saw again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As at eventide he saw it when he fought on the grassy plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he saw from the hall of the palace full many a maiden gaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many were fair to look on; and he thought, with a great amaze,                     <span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That a wondrous watch they must keep there, since they wearied not thro' the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And little might they have slumbered, for as yet scarce had dawned the light.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he thought, 'For the sake of these ladies will I lay me to sleep once more.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then again to his couch he gat him, and for covering he drew him o'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mantle the maid had lent him&mdash;Did no man his slumber break?                        <span class="linenum">15</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, sorely the host had vexed him, if one should his guest awake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then of true heart bethought the maiden, who soft by her mother lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she roused her from out her slumber, and she took to the guest her way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And again he slept so sweetly&mdash;Then she thought her, that gentle maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fain would she do him service, and she sat her beside his bed,                    <span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair was she, and sweet to look on, and but seldom at eventide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or in hour of the early dawning, such venture has sought my side!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Short space ere Gawain awakened and beheld how she watched him there,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And he looked and he laughed upon her, 'God reward thee, thou maiden fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou breakest for me thy slumber, on thyself dost thou vengeance take,            <span class="linenum">25</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since nor service nor joust so knightly have I ridden for thy sweet sake!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she answered, that gracious maiden, 'On thy service no claim have I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But look thou with favour on me, and thy will do I willingly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all who are with my father, yea, mother alike and child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do hail thee their lord and master, for love of thy dealings mild!'                    <span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he quoth, 'Is it long since thou camest? Had I of thy coming known<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fain would I have asked a question, perchance thou the truth hadst shown:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yestreen and again this morning fair ladies have looked on me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From a mighty tower, of thy goodness now tell me who may they be?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the maiden she shrunk in terror, and she cried, 'Ask me not, Sir Knight,           <span class="linenum">35</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since ne'er may I give an answer&mdash;I prithee to hear aright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I knew, yet I might not tell thee, nor do thou my silence chide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ask thou what else shall please thee and my lips naught from thee shall hide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But on this thing alone keep silence, and follow thou what I say!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Gawain, he would ever ask her, and ever an answer pray,                            <span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">What ladies were they who sat there, and looked from that stately hall?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the maiden she wept full sorely, and aloud in her grief did call.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Twas yet in the early dawning, and her father he sought her side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor I deem me had he been wrathful if here did such chance betide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Gawain with the maid had striven, and had forced her unto his will,               <span class="linenum">45</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the maiden, so fair and gentle, in such wise did she hold her still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For beside the couch was she seated&mdash;Then her father he mildly spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Now weep not so sore, my daughter, for if one a jest doth make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereof thou at first art wrathful, yet I ween ere the time be long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall thy sorrow be changed to gladness, and thy wailing to joyful song!'              <span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quoth Gawain, 'Nay, mine host, naught hath chanced here save that which thine eye may see;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This maiden I fain would question, but naught would she tell to me,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For she thinketh, 'tis my undoing, and silence hath she implored:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now if it shall not vex thee let my service here find reward,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tell me, mine host, if it please thee, how it stands with those ladies there,      <span class="linenum">55</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I know not the place or the country where I looked on such maidens fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So many there are, and their raiment showeth clear to my wondering sight!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the host wrung his hands for sorrow, and he spake, 'Ask me not, Sir Knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the name of God, ask no question&mdash;For wherever thy foot shall speed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or whatever thine eyes shall light on, no need shall be like their need!'              <span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Then soothly I'll mourn for their sorrow,' quoth Gawain, 'but mine host now say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why vex thee so sore for my question? Thine answer why thus delay?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Sir Knight, for thy manhood mourn I, if thou wilt not thy question spare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then strife sure shall be thy portion, and sorrow thine heart shall bear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thy sorrow of joy shall rob us, myself and my children three,                      <span class="linenum">65</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who were born for thy gallant service true service to yield to thee.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quoth Gawain, 'Yet for this thou shalt tell me, or if thou still say me, Nay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I learn not from thee the story yet the truth will I know alway!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the host he spake out truly, 'Sir Knight, I must sorely rue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The question thou here dost ask me&mdash;Thou goest to strife anew,                         <span class="linenum">70</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arm thee well, and a shield I'll lend thee&mdash;In "Terre Merveil" thou art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the "Lit Merveil" shall be here&mdash;And ne'er hath a knightly heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Withstood all the many dangers that in Ch&acirc;teau Merveil shall be!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn aside, ere thy death o'ertake thee, for life should be dear to thee!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For wherever thine hand shall have striven, or what ventures soe'er it found           <span class="linenum">75</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As child's play have been thy perils to those which beset this ground!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quoth Gawain, 'Yet 'twould sorely vex me, if I, but to save me pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rode hence, doing naught, and those ladies had looked for mine aid in vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long since have I heard of this castle, and since it so near doth stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No man from the task shall bring me; to the venture I set my hand!'                    <span class="linenum">80</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the host he did sore bemoan him, and he spake to his guest so true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Now as naught is all other peril, what perils around thee drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the peril of this adventure, to its awe, and its anguish dire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And naught but the truth am I speaking, for no man ever spake me liar!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that gallant knight, Sir Gawain, for naught would he turn aside,                   <span class="linenum">85</span><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But he quoth, 'Now mine host give counsel how the strife I may best abide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thy words be the words of wisdom, and God give me the strength thereto,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy will and thy rede I'll follow, and knightly the deeds I'll do!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sir Host, of a sooth it were ill done, did I fail here a blow to strike,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And coward should I be accounted of foeman and friend alike.'                          <span class="linenum">90</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then first did the host bemoan him, such sorrow he ne'er might know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he quoth to his guest, 'If it may be that Heaven such grace shall show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That death be not here thy portion, then this land unto thee shall fall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the stake is full many a maiden fast bound in a magic thrall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No man ere this day hath freed them&mdash;And with them many noble knights                  <span class="linenum">95</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall lie as yet imprisoned; and if thou with hand of might<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall loose them, thou winnest glory, and God showeth grace to thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And joyful, o'er light and beauty, king and ruler thou sure shalt be!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And maidens from many a country shall honour thee as their king.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor think, if thou now dost ride hence, such deed shame on thee should bring,         <span class="linenum">100</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since on this field Lischois Giwellius hath yielded him to thine hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left unto thee his honour; who erstwhile in every land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath done gallant deeds of knighthood, of right may I praise his name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No knight showed a higher courage, or won him a fairer fame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in no heart the root of virtue it showeth such fair increase                      <span class="linenum">105</span><br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quoth Gawain, 'Say, whence came he hither? Mine host, since he rode so near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knew he naught of the wondrous venture? Or did he the marvel hear?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Sir Knight, ne'er a word hath he heard here, I guarded me all too well,              <span class="linenum">115</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">And now, if ye fain would hearken what unto Gawain befell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tale of his wondrous venture right gladly to ye I'll tell.                        <span class="linenum">160</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And in this wise I heard the story&mdash;As he came to the castle gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A merchant with merchandise costly without did his coming wait.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so rich were his wares, and precious, that in sooth I were glad at heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I, in so great a treasure, my portion might bear and part.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, Sir Gawain, he sprang from his charger, for ne'er had he seen before            <span class="linenum">165</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outspread in the open market such goods as were here in store.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the booth was of velvet fashioned, four-square, and both wide and high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that which lay there for purchase no monarch might lightly buy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Baruch of Bagdad scarcely had paid that which lay therein;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor the Patriarch of Rankulat might think him such prize to win.                      <span class="linenum">170</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, and great as shall be the treasure that was found but awhile ago<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the land of the Greeks yet their Emperor such riches might hardly know!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And e'en if these twain had helped him the price he had failed to pay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That a man must count for the treasure that here before Gawain lay.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the knight greeted well the merchant as he looked on the wondrous store          <span class="linenum">175</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of marvels that lay before him, but he stayed not to turn it o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But bade him show clasp and girdle; then he quoth to the hero bold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'For many a year have I sat here, yet no man doth my wares behold;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
<span class="i0">None but ladies have looked upon them! yet if manhood shall nerve thine hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all here shalt thou be the master; they were brought from a distant land,          <span class="linenum">180</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">If here thou shalt be the victor, (for in sooth hast thou come for fight,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the venture shall well betide thee, I will deal with thee well, Sir Knight!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all that my booth containeth is thine if thou win the day!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So trust thou in God and His mercy, and take to the Burg thy way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plippalin&ograve;t in sooth hath sent thee, and thy coming well praised shall be             <span class="linenum">185</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of many a gracious maiden if thy prowess shall set her free!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Now wouldst thou withstand this venture leave here for awhile thy steed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou trust it unto my keeping, I will give to the charge good heed.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quoth Gawain, 'Yea, I'll gladly do so, if unseemly be not the task,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too greatly I fear thy riches such grace from thine hand to ask,                      <span class="linenum">190</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ne'er since I rode upon it such keeper my steed hath known'&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out quoth the merchant freely, 'Sir Knight, all shall be thine own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Myself, and the wares I guard here, (nor further of them I'll speak,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are his, who in safety faceth the danger thou here dost seek!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And so bold was I ween the hero that on foot did he go straightway,                   <span class="linenum">195</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Undaunted, to face the peril untold that before him lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as I before have told ye, the Burg it stood high and wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And its bulwarks so stoutly builded did guard it on either side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If for thirty years they stormed it, not a berry or leaf would yield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">However the foe might threaten; in the midst was a grassy field,                      <span class="linenum">200</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Yet the Lechfeld I ween is longer,) many turrets they towered on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the story it tells that Gawain, as the palace he did espy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw the roof shine all many-coloured, as peacock's plumes its glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so bright it was that its glory was dimmed nor by rain nor snow.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And within was it richly furnished, and decked to delight the eye,                    <span class="linenum">205</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the pillars were richly carven, and the windows were arched on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a fair couch costly had they set there against the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor touched they the one to the other, and rich covers lay over all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And but now had the maidens sat there, but each one had taken thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no one of them all remained there, and of welcome Gawain found naught.            <span class="linenum">210</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet their joy came again with his coming, and the day of their bliss was he,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And 'twere well they had looked upon him, none fairer their eyes might see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet none there might dare behold him, tho' to serve them he aye was fain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet in this thing were they guiltless&mdash;Thro' the palace strode knight Gawain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he looked on this side and the other, and he sought well the chamber o'er,        <span class="linenum">215</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">If to left or to right I know not, but he saw there an open door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wherever that door might lead him the hero was fain to go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If high fame he might gain for his seeking, or die there a death of woe!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So stepped he within the chamber, and behold! the shining floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As glass it lay smooth beneath him, and the Lit-Merveil he saw,                       <span class="linenum">220</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wonder-couch; and beneath it four rollers as crystal clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fashioned of fire-red rubies: as the swift wind afar and near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did it speed o'er the shining pavement, no floor might fairer be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chrysolite, sardius, jasper, inwrought there the eye might see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For so had Klingsor willed it, and the thought it was his alone,                      <span class="linenum">225</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">From far-off lands his magic had brought to the Burg each stone.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So smooth 'neath his feet the pavement, scarce might be his footing hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then fain would he seek the venture, but, so is the marvel told,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As ever he stood before it the couch from its station fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swift as the winds of heaven o'er the glittering floor it sped.                   <span class="linenum">230</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">(And Gawain he found all too heavy the shield that his hand gripped fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet did his host give counsel it should ne'er on one side be cast.)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thought Gawain, 'Now, how may I reach thee, since still thou dost fly from me?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Methinks thou shalt have a lesson, it may be I may spring to thee!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then still stood the couch before him, and straight from the ground he leapt          <span class="linenum">235</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stood firm in the midst of the marvel, and again o'er the floor it swept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hither and thither turning in the four walls its goal it found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blow upon blow fell swiftly, till the Burg echoed back the sound.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And many a charge did he ride there, with crash, as of thunder-cloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or as trumpeters blow together when their blasts thro' the hall ring loud,            <span class="linenum">240</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the one vieth with the other, and each for a fair prize blows.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Less loud should have been their tumult than the tumult that there arose!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And waken and watch must Sir Gawain, altho' on a bed he lay.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
<span class="i0">How best might the hero guard him? The noise he was fain to stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his head with his shield he covered&mdash;There he lay, and would wait His will        <span class="linenum">245</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who hath help in His power, and helpeth all those who entreat Him still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shutteth His ear to no man who in sorrow for aid doth pray.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the man who is wise and steadfast, as dawneth his sorrow's day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doth call on the hand of the Highest, that shall ne'er be too short to reach,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the aid that shall meet their lacking He sendeth to all and each.                 <span class="linenum">250</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so was it now with Gawain&mdash;Thro' Whose grace he had gotten fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He called on His power and His mercy to shelter him here from shame.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then stilled for a space the clamour&mdash;The couch stood within the hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And an equal space had they measured from its station to either wall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet now waxed his peril greater, for five hundred missiles, swung                     <span class="linenum">255</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With craft from hands yet hidden, were against Sir Gawain flung.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they fell on the couch as he lay there; but the shield it was hard and new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it sheltered him well, and I think me of the blows did he feel but few.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the stones were as river pebbles, so heavy, and hard, and round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in many a place on the surface of the shield might their trace be found.          <span class="linenum">260</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At length was the stone-shower ended, and never before he knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such sharp and such heavy missiles as those which toward him flew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For now full five hundred cross-bows were bended, their bolts they sped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each one was aimed at the hero as he lay on the Wonder-Bed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(And he who hath faced such peril in sooth he of darts may tell:)                     <span class="linenum">265</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet their wrath was soon spent, and silence for awhile on the chamber fell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he who would seek for comfort he ne'er on such couch should lie!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little solace or rest may he find there, but peace from his face shall fly!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And youth would wax grey and ag&egrave;d, if such comfort should be its share<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As fell to the lot of Gawain, when he lay on that couch so fair.                      <span class="linenum">270</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet nor weariness nor terror had weakened or hand or heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho' the stones and the bolts of the cross-bow had done on his limbs their part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spite of both shield and corslet, sore bruis&egrave;d and cut was he:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he thought that, this peril ended, the venture should ended be&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But yet with his hand must he battle, and the prize of the victor win,                <span class="linenum">275</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a doorway e'en now flew open, and one trode the hall within;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And the man was a mighty peasant, and fearful of face, and grim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the hide of the grey sea-otter was his covering on head and limb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his hosen were wide, and he carried a club in his strong right hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And 'twas thicker I ween than a pitcher that round-bellied doth firmly stand.         <span class="linenum">280</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So came he unto Sir Gawain, (and his coming it pleased him ill,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet he thought, 'He doth bear no harness, mine arms shall withstand him still,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upright on the couch he sat him, as nor terror nor pain he knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the peasant, as he would flee him, a space from the bed withdrew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he cried in a voice so wrathful, 'From <i>me</i> hast thou naught to fear,             <span class="linenum">285</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet such peril I'll loose upon thee that thy life must thou buy full dear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The devil himself doth aid thee, else wert thou not still in life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bethink thee, for death cometh swiftly, and the ending of all thy strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more can the devil shield thee, that I tell thee ere hence I pass!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he gat him once more thro' the doorway, and Gawain gripped his sword-hilt fast,  <span class="linenum">290</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the shafts did he smite asunder of the arrows that thro' his shield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had passed, and had pierced his armour, nor yet to his hand would yield.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then a roar, as of mighty thunder, on the ear of Gawain did fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when twenty drums were sounding to dance in the castle hall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the hero, so firm and dauntless, whose courage ne'er felt the smart              <span class="linenum">295</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the wounds that cowardice pierceth, thought thus in his steadfast heart:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'What evil shall now befall me? Must I yet more sorrow know?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For sorrow enow have I seen here, yet here will I face my foe!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He looked toward the peasant's doorway, and a mighty lion sprang thro',<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And its size was e'en that of a warhorse, and straight on Gawain it flew.             <span class="linenum">300</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Gawain he was loth to fly here, and his shield he held fast before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As best for defence should serve him, and he sprang down upon the floor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the lion was hunger-ravening, yet little should find for food,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho' raging it sprang on the hero, who bravely its rush withstood.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The shield it had near torn from him, with the first grip its talons fierce           <span class="linenum">305</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">It drave thro' the wood, such hardness but seldom a beast may pierce.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet Gawain did right well defend him, his sword-blade aloft he swung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on three feet the beast must hold him, while the fourth from the shield yet hung.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And the blood gushed forth on the pavement, and Gawain he firmer stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fight raged hither and thither, as the lion, on the hero good,                <span class="linenum">310</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sprang ever with snorting nostrils, and gleaming fangs and white&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if on such food they had reared it, that its meat was a gallant knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I</i> had cared not to sit beside it! Nor such custom pleased Gawain well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who for life or for death must fight it&mdash;and the strife ever fiercer fell.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So sorely the beast was wounded, the chamber with blood ran o'er;                     <span class="linenum">315</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fierce sprang the lion upon Gawain, and would bear him unto the floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Gawain a sword-thrust dealt him, thro' the heart the swift blade sped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till his hand smote full on the breast-bone, and the lion at his feet fell dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now all the deadly peril and the conflict was over-past&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the same hour Gawain bethought him, 'Where now shall my lot be cast?               <span class="linenum">320</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since to sit in this blood I like not, and I must of the couch beware,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For it runneth a race so frantic 'twere foolish to sit me there!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But yet was his head so deafened with the blows that upon him fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many his wounds, and the life-blood did forth from its fountains well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his strength waxed faint, and it left him, and he fell on the chamber floor;      <span class="linenum">325</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His head lay on the lion's body, and the shield might he hold no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if wisdom and power were his portion, of the twain was he reft I ween,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tho' fair was the Burg, yet within it full rough had his handling been.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His senses forsook him wholly&mdash;no such pillow I ween was his<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As that which on Mount Ribbel&eacute; Gymele gave to Kahenis;                                <span class="linenum">330</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both fair and wise was the maiden&mdash;and his honour he slept away&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But here honour ran swift-footed to Gawain as he prostrate lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in sooth ye shall well have hearkened, and shall know how such chance befell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thus lay the hero lifeless, from the first have ye heard it well.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then in secret one looked upon him, and the chamber with blood was red,               <span class="linenum">335</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the lion alike and the hero they lay as the twain were dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas a fair and gracious maiden who saw thro' a loop-hole high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her face it grew wan, and the colour from her lips and her cheek must fly.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And youth was so heavy-hearted that old age sore must mourn her tale.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet Arniv&eacute; was wise, and her wisdom did here o'er the woe prevail,                    <span class="linenum">340</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still for this deed must I praise her, she drew near to aid Gawain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from peril of death she freed him who freedom for her would gain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then herself she was fain to behold him, and they gazed thro' the window small,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And naught might they tell, those women, of what waited them in the hall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was it news of a joyful future? Or of woe that should last for aye?                   <span class="linenum">345</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the queen's heart it sore misgave her that the hero had died that day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(And the thought brought her grief and sorrow,) since he sought him no better bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But silent he lay, and rested on the corse of the lion his head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she spake, 'From my heart I mourn thee, if thy manhood so true and brave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath won thee no better guerdon, and thy life thou hast failed to save.               <span class="linenum">350</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">If death here hath been thy portion for our sake, who shall strangers be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thy truth to such fate hath brought thee, then for ever I'll mourn for thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thy virtue I'll praise, tho' the counting of thy years I may never know!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she spake to the weeping women, as they looked on the knight laid low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Ye maids who shall be baptiz&egrave;d, and by water have won a place                        <span class="linenum">355</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In God's kingdom, pray ye unto Him, that He show to this hero grace!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then she sent below two maidens, and she bade them to seek Gawain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And softly draw nigh unto him, nor pass from his side again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till they brought her full assurance how it went with the gallant knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If perchance he should yet be living, or had found his death in fight.                <span class="linenum">360</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So she gave to the twain commandment&mdash;Did they weep those maidens fair?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, both must weep full sorely for the grief that was here their share,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they found the hero lying, for his wounds they ran with blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the shield in blood was swimming&mdash;then they bent o'er the hero good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with gentle hand the helmet one loosened from off his head,                       <span class="linenum">365</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she saw a light foam gathered upon his lips so red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she waited a space and hearkened, if perchance she might hear his breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For but now had she thought him living, yet she deemed it might well be death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his over-dress was of sable, and the mystic beasts it bore,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Such as Ilinot the Breton as his badge with great honour wore.                        <span class="linenum">370</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">(And courage and fame were his portion from his youth till his dying day.)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the coat with her ready fingers the sable she tore away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she held it before his nostrils, for thus might she better know<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the breath was yet there, and straightway she bade her companion bring            <span class="linenum">375</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair water, the gentle maiden did swift on her errand spring.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the maid placed her ring so golden betwixt his teeth closed fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deft was her hand in the doing, and between his lips she passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drop by drop, e'en as he might take it, the water, and little space<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere he lifted once more his eyelids, and he looked on the maiden's face.              <span class="linenum">380</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he thanked them, those two sweet children, and offered them service meet&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! that ye here should find me, unseemly laid at your feet!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If ye will on this chance keep silence, for good will I count the deed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And courtesy shall ye honour if ye give to my words good heed!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quoth the maid, 'Thou hast lain, and thou liest, as one who the prize doth hold,      <span class="linenum">385</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sooth thou art here the victor and in joy shall thy life wax old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-day is thy day of triumph! But comfort us now I pray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it so with thy wounds that, naught fearing, we may joy in thy joy to-day?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he quoth, 'Would ye see me living, then help shall ye bring to me.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he prayed of those gracious maidens that a leech to his wounds should see,        <span class="linenum">390</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or one who was skilled in healing, 'But if yet I must face the strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go ye hence, give me here my helmet, and gladly I'll guard my life!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they spake, 'Nay, the strife is over, Sir Knight, send us not away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet one shall go, and the guerdon of messenger win straightway.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the four queens shall she betake her, and shall say that thou livest still,        <span class="linenum">395</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a chamber shall they prepare thee, and leechcraft with right goodwill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with salves shall thy wounds be tended, and so mild shall their working be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thy pain shall be swiftly lessened, and healing be brought to thee!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then one of the maids sprang swiftly, and she ran with no halting tread,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With the news that the knight was living straightway to the court she sped.           <span class="linenum">400</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">'In sooth shall he be so living, if ever it be God's will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rich in joy may we be henceforward and glad without fear of ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For naught but good help he needeth,' 'Dieu Merci!' then quoth they all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the old queen wise her maidens did straightway around her call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she bade them a bed prepare him, and a carpet she spread before,                  <span class="linenum">405</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a fire on the hearth burnt brightly, and precious the salves they bore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the queen with wisdom mixed them for the healing of cut or bruise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that hour from among her women four maids did Arniv&eacute; choose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she bade them disarm the hero, and his harness bear soft away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with wisdom should they deal with him lest he feel himself shamed alway.          <span class="linenum">410</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">'A silk shall ye bear about ye, in its shadow the knight disarm,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then I think me I soon may heal him, but if wounded he be to death                    <span class="linenum">415</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then cloven our joy&mdash;with the hero are we slain tho' we yet draw breath!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And all this was done as she bade them, disarmed was the knight Gawain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they led him where help they gave him who well knew to ease his pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of wounds did they find full fifty, or perchance they were even more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the darts had not pierced too deeply since ever his shield he bore.               <span class="linenum">420</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the queen in her wisdom took her warm wine, and a sendal blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Dictam, the herb of healing, and she wiped with her hand so true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blood from his wounds, and she closed them, and the flow of the life-blood stayed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wherever his helm was indented the stones on his head had made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sore bruises, yet they must vanish 'fore the salves and their healing power,          <span class="linenum">425</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the master-skill of Arniv&eacute; who tended him in that hour!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And she quoth, 'Ease I well may give thee, whiles Kondrie doth come to me,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Since Anfortas so sore doth suffer, and they seek aid from far and near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This salve shall from death have kept him, from Monsalv&auml;sch 'twas brought me here.'   <span class="linenum">430</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Gawain heard she spake of Monsalv&auml;sch, then in sooth was he glad at heart,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For he deemed it was near&mdash;Then this hero, who ne'er had in falsehood part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spake thus to the queen, 'Now, Lady, my senses that far were fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hast thou won back again, and mine anguish I ween hast thou minish&egrave;d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What of strength shall be mine, or of wisdom, I owe to thine hand alone,              <span class="linenum">435</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy servant am I!' But the queen spake, 'Sir Knight, thou such faith hast shown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That we all must rejoice in thy welfare, and strive for it faithfully.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But follow my rede, nor speak much, a root will I give to thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shall win thee refreshing slumber, thou shalt care not for drink or meat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the night, then such food I'll bring thee thou shalt need not ere morn to eat.'  <span class="linenum">440</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then a root 'twixt his lips she laid there, and straightway he fell asleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And throughout the day he slumbered, and in coverings they happed him deep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rich in honour and poor in shaming, soft and warm, there in peace he lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet he sneezed, and at whiles he shivered, for the salve wrought on him alway.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a company of fair women passed within and without the door,                       <span class="linenum">445</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fair was the light of their faces, and stately the mien they bore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she bade them, the Queen Arniv&eacute;, that silence they all should keep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None should call, and no maiden answer, so long as the knight should sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she bade them fast close the palace, nor burger, nor squire, nor knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should hear what had there befallen till the dawn of the morning light.               <span class="linenum">450</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But new sorrow drew nigh to the women&mdash;The knight slept till even grey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Arniv&eacute; the queen in her wisdom drew the root from his lips away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And straightway he woke, and he thirsted, and they brought him of drink and meat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he raised himself and, rejoicing, as they brought him so would he eat:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a maid stood before him, such fair service he ne'er had known,               <span class="linenum">455</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So courteous their mien and bearing&mdash;then he looked at them one by one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he gazed at each and the other, yet still his desire was set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the lady Orgelus&eacute;, for ne'er saw he woman yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all the days of his lifetime, who so near to his heart did lie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho' many his prayer had hearkened, and <i>some</i> did their love deny!                   <span class="linenum">460</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then out spake the gallant hero to Arniv&eacute;, his leech so wise,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
<span class="i0">'Lady, 'twill ill beseem me, nor deal I in courteous guise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If these ladies stand here before me, I would they might seated be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or if such be thy will it were better shouldst thou bid them to eat with me!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Nay, Sir Knight, none I ween may sit here save I, the queen, alone,                  <span class="linenum">465</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shamed would they surely hold them were such service not gladly done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For our joy shalt thou be; yet I think me that if this be thy will indeed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whate'er shall be thy commandment, we will give to thy words good heed.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But nobly born were those ladies, and their courtesy did they show,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all with one voice they prayed him he would e'en let the thing be so,             <span class="linenum">470</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while he should eat they would stand there; so waited they on the guest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And passed hence when the meal was ended and Gawain was laid to rest.<br /></span>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>

<p>In Book <span class="smcap">XII.</span> the poet recounts the valiant deeds done by Gawain's
kinsmen for love's sake, and how they were as naught to the perils dared
by Gawain.</p>

<p>Of the watch-tower in the castle, and the magic pillar, and how Gawain
beheld the coming of Orgelus&eacute; and her knight.</p>

<p>How Gawain fought with and overcame the Turkowit, and how he was
urged by Orgelus&eacute;'s mockery to the venture of the Perilous Ford. How
he plucked a bough from a tree guarded by King Gramoflanz, and was
challenged by that monarch to single combat. Of the repentance of
Orgelus&eacute;, and her reconciliation with Gawain, and how both were welcomed
by the dwellers in Ch&acirc;teau Merveil. How Gawain secretly sent a
squire to the court of King Arthur bidding him, his knights and ladies, to
Ioflanz to witness the combat between Gawain and Gramoflanz.</p>

<span class="i0">Now he who his rest had broken, if rest he perchance might win,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Methinks they who hear the story had counted it him for sin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, e'en as the venture telleth, sore toil had the hero known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in sooth did he face such peril that his fame thro' all lands hath flown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lancelot on the sword-bridge battled, and Meljakanz must sue for grace,                 <span class="linenum">5</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Who o'erthrew the lion 'fore the palace and made Nantes with his daring ring&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Perilous Ford hath its dangers; and Erec must sorrow know,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For narrow I ween was the pathway that led to her resting-place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all sorrow he knew aforetime was as nought to this bitter woe,                     <span class="linenum">25</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a low wall it was that hid her when his heart did her presence know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In whose service he never faltered, but was watchful as he was true.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor find ye here food for laughter, that one who ne'er terror knew,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Who harm on a wounded foeman shall work doth his honour stain,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And he followed in this his father, and the men of his mother's land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they yielded thee loyal service since the days Mazadan was king,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And he fled from the land of his fathers in the days of his youth's unrest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And was reared by this queen, and Britain ne'er saw him but as a guest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the burden of Love weighed on him, and from Florie's land he fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the day that in true love's service, as I told ye, men found him dead.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of chrysolite, emerald, ruby, and sardius, the windows tall,                          <span class="linenum">105</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That each one like to the other encircled this wondrous hall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rich as the window columns, and carven, the roof o'erhead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And herein was a greater marvel than all marvels ye yet have read;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For, the vault below, no pillar was like to that column fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That stood in the midst of the circle, and wondrous the power it bare,                <span class="linenum">110</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For so the venture telleth&mdash;Gawain fain would gaze around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And alone did he climb the watch-tower, and precious the jewels he found.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he saw there a greater wonder, and the sight never vexed his eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he thought him upon the column all the lands of the earth did lie.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he saw the countries circle, and the mighty mountains' crest                      <span class="linenum">115</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meet, e'en as two hosts in battle, as one vision the other pressed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And folk did he see in the pillar, and on horse or afoot they went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They ran, and they stood: in a window he sat him on seeing bent.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Came the ag&egrave;d Queen Arniv&eacute;, with Sangiv&eacute; her child, and there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were two maidens, the gentle daughters that Sangiv&eacute; erewhile did bear.                <span class="linenum">120</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the four queens they came unto Gawain, and he saw them and sprang upright;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus quoth the Queen Arniv&eacute;, 'Methinks thou shouldst sleep, Sir Knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For though rest may no longer please thee, thou art wounded too sore, I trow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou further toil and labour shouldst yet for a season know!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quoth the knight, 'Lady mine and my mistress, since thy wisdom hath brought to me     <span class="linenum">125</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">My wit, and my strength, all my lifetime thy servant I fain would be!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quoth the queen, 'If I so may read them, the words thou didst speak but now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou ownest me as thy mistress, then Sir Knight, to my bidding bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kiss at my will these ladies, as thou mayest, without thought of shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since nor mother nor maid before thee but a kingly birth may claim!'                  <span class="linenum">130</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then glad was Gawain at her bidding, and he kissed those ladies three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sangiv&eacute; was first, then Itonj&eacute;, and the third was the fair Kondrie.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the five sat them down together, and Gawain saw those maidens twain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their face and their form so gracious, and he looked, and he looked again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet one woman so worked upon him, for yet in his heart she lay,                       <span class="linenum">135</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That their beauty by Orgelus&eacute;'s he deemed but a cloudy day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he held with the Lady of Logrois none other might well compare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his heart and his thoughts were captive to this lady so sweet and fair.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now 'twas done, and Gawain had been greeted with a kiss by those ladies three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so fair were they all that I wot well their beauty would fatal be                 <span class="linenum">140</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a heart that was yet unwounded&mdash;Then he spake to the elder queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he prayed her to tell of the pillar, and the marvels he there had seen.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quoth Arniv&eacute;, 'By day and by night-time that pillar, I ween, doth throw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its light for six miles around it, so long as its power I know.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all that within that circuit doth chance on its face we see,                      <span class="linenum">145</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In water, or on the meadow, and true shall the vision be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bird and the beast we see here, the guest and the woodman true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He who to this land is a stranger, or its ways of aforetime knew.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, all may we find within it, and it shineth for six miles round;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And no hammer shall ever harm it, and no smith hath, I ween, the skill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas stolen from Queen Sekundill&eacute;, I think me, against her will!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now Gawain he saw at this moment on the column a goodly pair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A knight with a lady riding, and he thought him the maid was fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clearly and well he saw them&mdash;and armed were both steed and knight,               <span class="linenum">155</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his helmet was plumed and jewelled, and it gleamed in the morning light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they rode at a hasty gallop thro' the defile out on the plain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho' I wot well he little knew it, yet they rode but to seek Gawain!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And they came by the self-same pathway that Lischois he rode afore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The proud knight whom Gawain had vanquished, and in joust from his charger bore.      <span class="linenum">160</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the lady she held the bridle of the knight who to joust would ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sight to Gawain brought sorrow, and swiftly he turned aside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And behold! 'twas no lying vision, for without on the grassy plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the river rode Orgelus&eacute;, and a knight at her side drew rein.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'en as hellebore within the nostril pierceth sharp, and a man doth sneeze,           <span class="linenum">165</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thro' his eye to his heart came the Duchess, and she robbed him of joy and ease!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Alas! I wot well 'gainst Frau Minne all helpless shall be Gawain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he looked on the knight who rode there, and he spake to the queen again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Lady, a knight I see there, who rideth with well-aimed spear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor will cease from the goal he seeketh&mdash;Well! I ween he may find it here,            <span class="linenum">170</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since he craveth some deed of knighthood I am ready with him to fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But say, who shall be the maiden?' she quoth, ''Tis the lady bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is Duchess and queen of Logrois,&mdash;Now 'gainst whom doth she bear ill-will?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the Turkowit rideth with her, and unconquered shall he be still.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his spear such fame hath he won him, as were riches for kingdoms three,          <span class="linenum">175</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And against a hand so valiant 'twere best not to venture thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For strife is it all too early, and thou shalt be hurt too sore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And e'en wert thou whole I should rede thee to strive with him nevermore!'<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Quoth Gawain, 'If indeed I be lord here then he who so near shall seek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deeds of knighthood, shall shame mine honour if vengeance I fail to wreak.            <span class="linenum">180</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since he lusteth for strife, O Lady, thou shalt give me mine armour here!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the ladies, the four, bewailed them with many a bitter tear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they quoth, 'Wilt thou deck thy glory? wilt thou greater honour know?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strive not now, shouldst thou fall before him then greater shall wax our woe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But e'en if thou be the victor, if thou girdest thine harness on                      <span class="linenum">185</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou must die who so sore art wounded, and with thee are we all undone!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Gawain, he was sorely anguished, and the cause have ye heard aright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he counted himself dishonoured by the coming of such a knight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his wounds, they must sorely pain him, yet love's torment it vexed him more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the grief of these four fair ladies, and the love they towards him bore.          <span class="linenum">190</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he bade them to cease from weeping, and harness and sword he craved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his charger; and those fair women they led forth the hero brave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he bade them go forth before him, and adown the steps they wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the hall where the other maidens so sweet and so fair they find.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Gawain for his perilous journey was armed 'neath the light of eyes               <span class="linenum">195</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tear-dimmed, and they secret held it, and none knew save the merchant wise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they bade him the steed make ready, and the hero he slowly stept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the place where his charger waited&mdash;nor light on its back he leapt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But scarcely his shield might he carry, for in sooth was he wounded sore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thro' centre and rim was it pierc&egrave;d, and traces of battle bore!                   <span class="linenum">200</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then again he bestrode his charger, and he turned from the Burg away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he rode to his host so faithful; and never he said him Nay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all that he asked he gave him, a spear both strong and new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Many such had, I ween, been his tribute from that plain where they jousted true,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Gawain bade him ship him over, in a ferry they sought the shore,                 <span class="linenum">205</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Turkowit, who high courage and the thought of sure victory bore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For so well against shame was he arm&egrave;d that ill-deeds from before him fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his fame was so high accounted, that they made of the sward their bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who would ride a joust against him&mdash;From their charger they needs must fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of those who had faced his valour, his spear had o'erthrown them all.             <span class="linenum">210</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this was the rule of the hero, that by spear-thrust, and no sword-blade,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Would he win to him fame in battle, or his honour be prostrate laid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to him who should face his onslaught, and o'erthrow him, the self-same day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would he yield, nor defend him further, but would give him his pledge straightway.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And thus heard Gawain the story from him who the pledge did hold,                     <span class="linenum">215</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his pledge Plippalin&ograve;t took there, when the tale of the joust was told.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did one fall while the other sat still, with goodwill of the heroes twain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did he take that which one must forfeit, and the other methinks should gain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the charger I speak, hence he led it, for he deemed they enough had fought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who was victor, and who the vanquished, from the Burg were the tidings brought,       <span class="linenum">220</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the women, they looked on the jousting, and many a conflict saw.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he bade Gawain seat him firmly, and the charger he led to shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his shield and his spear he gave him&mdash;and the Turkowit swiftly came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one who his joust can measure, nor too high nor too low his aim.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Gawain turned his horse against him&mdash;of Monsalv&auml;sch, Gringuljet,                  <span class="linenum">225</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it answered unto the bridle, and his spear 'gainst the foe he set.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now forward!&mdash;the joust be ridden&mdash;Here rideth King Lot's fair son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Undaunted his heart&mdash;Now know ye where the helm hath its fastening won?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For there did his foeman strike him; but Gawain sought another aim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swift thro' the helmet's visor with sure hand the spear-point came,               <span class="linenum">230</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And plain to the sight of all men was the fate of the joust that day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On his spear short and strong the helmet from his head Gawain bare away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And onward it rode, the helmet! But the knight on the grass lay low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who was blossom and flower of all manhood till he met with such mighty foe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now he in joust was vanquished, and the jewels from his helm were seen            <span class="linenum">235</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To vie with the dew on the herbage and the flowers on the meadow green.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Gawain, he rode back unto him, and his pledge did he take that day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the boatman he claimed the charger, who was there should say him Nay?<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thou art joyful, and yet hast small reason,' spake the lady of Gawain's love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(As of old were her words of mocking,) 'Since wherever thy shield doth move           <span class="linenum">240</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lion's paw doth follow&mdash;And thou thinkest fresh fame to gain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since the ladies have looked on thy jousting&mdash;-Well thou mayst in thy bliss remain,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thou art doubtless too sorely wounded to yearn for a further fray?                    <span class="linenum">245</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And such ill to the 'Goose' be reckoned, that I called thee but yesterday.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So eager wert thou to vaunt thee, as a sieve hast thou pierc&egrave;d thro'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy shield, one would deem it riddled with the darts that toward thee flew.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ride hence to the maids of the castle, for well will they care for thee!              <span class="linenum">250</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far other strife were <i>his</i> portion, to whom I a task would give,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did thine heart yet yearn for my favour, and thou wouldst in my service live!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quoth Gawain to the Duchess, 'Lady, tho' deep were my wounds I trow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They ere this have found help and healing&mdash;If such help I from thee might know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou, gracious, wouldst own my service, no peril would be so great,              <span class="linenum">255</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I, for thy love and rewarding, the issue would gladly wait!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quoth she, 'Then shalt thou ride with me new honour perchance to gain!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then rich in all joy and contentment was that valiant knight Gawain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Turkowit went with the boatman, and he bade him the tidings bear<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And his spear it was yet unsplintered, tho' both horses they spurred amain<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thou shalt find in my love rewarding!' Then he quoth, 'Wheresoe'er it stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tree that shall bring such blessing as reward unto this mine hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I not in vain bemoan me, but win hearing for this my grief,                        <span class="linenum">275</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Till it seemed him his grief of aforetime and his anguish had fled away&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus with her guest did she journey a space from the Burg that day,               <span class="linenum">280</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the road it was straight and easy, and it led thro' a forest fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Tamris I ween and Prisein were the names that the trees did bear,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Whose plucking shall win thee honour!' O'er the field ran a deep ravine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so near did they ride to the chasm that the tree from afar was seen.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As from me shall be thy rewarding! And here must I hold my way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor further may I ride with thee; but make thou no more delay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God have thee in His safe keeping! Thine horse must thou straightway bring<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thro' the plain&mdash;it was deep as a valley, and no man its waves might ford;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Gawain spurred his steed towards it, and he sprung o'er the flood so broad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet but the charger's fore-feet might light on the further side,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For swift and wide was the water; yet Gawain he had strength enow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho' heavy the weight of his armour, for he saw where there grew a bough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hung o'er the foaming torrent, and he grasped it, for life was dear,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For heavy I ween his harness, and his wounds they were deep and sore:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Was of love and of joy forsaken, then I feared lest I shamed should be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Klingsor, such power he wieldeth by the force of his magic spell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That maiden or man to his purpose can he force as shall please him well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All gallant folk that he seeth, unharmed may they ne'er go free&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus my riches to him I proffered, if so be he sware peace with me.                   <span class="linenum">530</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he that should brave the venture, and he that should win the prize,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To <i>him</i> I my love should offer; but if so be that in his eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My love were a thing unworthy, the booth should be mine again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now hast thou done my bidding, and it falleth unto us twain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And 'twas sworn in the ears of many, for thereby I hoped to lure                      <span class="linenum">535</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">My foe (yet in this I fail&egrave;d) for the strife he might ne'er endure.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Now courtly and wise is Klingsor; for his honour it pleased him well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That many a deed of knighthood, at my will, in his land befell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the hand of my valiant servants, with many a thrust and blow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the week, every day as it passes, and the weeks into years do grow,               <span class="linenum">540</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">My troops in their changing order beset him by night and day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For at great cost my snares so cunning for Gramoflanz did I lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many have striven with him, yet must him as victor own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet I still for his life am thirsting, and at last shall he be o'erthrown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some were too rich for my payment, and but for my love would serve,               <span class="linenum">545</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I bid them for <i>that</i> do me service, but reward did they ne'er deserve.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'And never a man beheld me but his service I swiftly won,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save <i>one</i>, and he bare red armour; to my folk he much ill had done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For hither he rode from Logrois, and he there did my knights o'erthrow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In such wise that they fell before him, and it pleased me but ill I trow.             <span class="linenum">550</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, between Logrois and thy meadow, five knights they followed fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he cast them to earth, and their chargers the boatman from thence must bear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then as he my knights had vanquished, I myself did the hero pray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For my love and my land to serve me, but naught would that red knight say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save he had a wife who was fairer, and should aye to his heart be dear.               <span class="linenum">555</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then wroth was I at his answer, and the name of his wife would hear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Wouldst thou know the name of my chosen?&mdash;She reigneth at Pelrap&auml;r,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And <i>Parzival</i> all men call me, and naught for thy love I care,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Other sorrow the Grail doth give me!" Then in anger he rode away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, I prithee, here give me counsel, if evil I did that day,                         <span class="linenum">560</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I, by heart-sorrow driven, proffered love to that gallant knight?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should I count my fair fame dishonoured?' Quoth Gawain to that lady bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'A gallant knight is he, truly, who thus thy desire hath crossed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had he to thy bidding hearkened no fame thou thro' him hadst lost!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Gawain, the courteous hero, and the lady his rein beside,                        <span class="linenum">565</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazed lovingly on each other&mdash;and so far on their way did ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That they drew anear to the castle, where the venture erewhile befell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they who looked forth might see them&mdash;-'Now, Lady, 'twould please me well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou do this thing that I ask thee, from all men my name withhold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which the knight who once stole my charger aloud in thine hearing told.               <span class="linenum">570</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But do this that I say, if any shall pray thee to tell my name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, "I know not the name of my true knight, none spake it when here he came."'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then she quoth, 'I will keep it secret, since thou wouldst not 'twere spoken here.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the knight and the lovely lady they rode to the Burg anear.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now the knights they had heard of the coming of one who, with valiant hand,           <span class="linenum">575</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faced the venture, and slew the lion, and the Turkowit dared withstand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, and had in fair joust o'erthrown him; and now on the flowery plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The meadow of strife, rode the hero, and they looked on the knight Gawain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the battlements could they see him; and the forces together draw;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with ringing blast of trumpet they pass thro' the castle door,                    <span class="linenum">580</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rich banners on high were tossing, and their steeds o'er the plain they flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he deemed that they came for battle, so swift they towards him drew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Gawain from afar might see them to the lady he spake again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Do they come here with thought of battle?' But she quoth, 'They are Klingsor's men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From afar have they seen thy coming, and they ride their new lord to greet,           <span class="linenum">585</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With joy would they bid thee welcome! Refuse not this honour meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since 'tis gladness that doth constrain them.' There, too, in a vessel fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plippalin&ograve;t  came to meet them, and his daughter with him did bear;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And swift o'er the flowery meadow the maiden towards them stept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And joyful she hailed the hero for whom she aforetime wept.                           <span class="linenum">590</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Gawain gave her courteous greeting, and stirrup and foot she kissed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she turned her to Orgelus&eacute;, nor the lady her welcome missed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she prayed him to 'light from his charger the while that she held the rein,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then to the ship she led them, the lady and knight Gawain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there, in the place of honour, a carpet and cushions lay,                         <span class="linenum">595</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Duchess by Gawain sat her, as the maiden the twain did pray.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her office the maid forgat not, she disarm&egrave;d the hero there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in sooth it is said that the mantle she did for his robing bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which had served him that night for cover, when he did 'neath her rooftree lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now was the hour for its wearing and it wrapped him right royally.                <span class="linenum">600</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So clad was Gawain in her mantle, and his own robe beneath he wore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the harness he laid from off him on one side the maiden bore.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now as they sat together for the first time the lady fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might look on his face and know him&mdash;Then unto the twain they bare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two game-birds that well were roasted, and with them a flask of wine,                 <span class="linenum">605</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And two cakes did the maiden bring them on a cloth that was white and fine&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The birds were the prey of the falcon&mdash;but Gawain and his lady bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must seek water themselves, if to wash them ere they ate here should seem them right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this did the twain; and joyful was the knight that he now might eat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her, for whose sake he would suffer joy, or sorrow, as seemed her meet.          <span class="linenum">610</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oft as the cup she gave him that her sweet lips had touched, anew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sprang his joy that he thus drank with her, and his sorrow behind him drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it halted nor might o'ertake him, and his gladness on swift foot sped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fair was her mouth and so rosy her lips that from grief he fled.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And no longer his wounds they pained him&mdash;Then the ladies from out the tower          <span class="linenum">615</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">They looked on the feast, and below them there rode in the self-same hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the further side of the river, brave knights who would show their skill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the boatman alike and his daughter Gawain thanked with right goodwill,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Ere yet he might ferry them over, and the lady spake with him there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the food and the drink they had brought them&mdash;Then out quoth the lady fair,       <span class="linenum">620</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Now what hath that knight befallen, who yestreen, ere I rode away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was o'erthrown in a joust by another? Was he slain, or doth live alway?'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quoth the boatman, 'He liveth, Lady, and he spake but this day with me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was given to me for his charger: if thy will be to set him free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his stead will I have the "swallow" that Queen Sekundill&eacute; sent                     <span class="linenum">625</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Anfortas, be thine the hero, with the harp were I well content!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Both the harp and the other riches that the booth may within it hold,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quoth the lady, 'are his who sits here, he may give them, or aye withhold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him do as he will! If he love me, Lischois he methinks will loose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor freedom unto the other, my prince, will he here refuse.                           <span class="linenum">630</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Florand of Itolac is he, of my night-watch was he the chief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as he as Turkowit served me, so his sorrow shall be my grief!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quoth Gawain to his lovely lady, 'Ere it weareth to eventide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt look on the twain in freedom!' Then they came to the further side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Duchess, so fair to look on, he lifted upon her steed,                        <span class="linenum">635</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a noble horseman were waiting them on the mead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And greeting fair they gave them; and they turned to the Burg again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And joyful they rode around them and skilful they drew the rein,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Buhurd was fair to look on&mdash;What more shall I tell ye here?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gawain, and his lovely lady, at the castle they found good cheer,                     <span class="linenum">640</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In such wise did the ladies greet them at Ch&acirc;teau Merveil that day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And good fortune had here befallen that such bliss should be his alway.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Arniv&eacute; she straightway led him to a chamber, and they who knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of such lore his hurts they tended, and they bound up his wounds anew.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quoth Gawain unto Arniv&eacute;, 'Give me, Lady, a messenger!'                               <span class="linenum">645</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then straightway she sent a maiden, and the maid brought again with her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A footman, both true and manly, as behov&egrave;d him well to be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And an oath did he swear unto Gawain, to serve him right faithfully,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, were it for joy or for sorrow, his errand to secret hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From all men, both there and elsewhere, till he came where it might be told.          <span class="linenum">650</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they brought to him ink and parchment, and Gawain, King Lot's fair son,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Wrote clear with his hand the message, and thus did the writing run&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To them who abode in L&ouml;ver's fair country, King Arthur brave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his queen, with a faith unstain&egrave;d, true service and good he gave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he said, had he fame deserv&egrave;d, and they would not his praise were slain,          <span class="linenum">655</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">They should come to his aid in his trouble, and show to him truth again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with following of knights and ladies to Ioflanz their way should wend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where he came himself, and his honour would in mortal strife defend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And further, this thing he told them, the foemen on either side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had pledged themselves in all honour and pomp to the field to ride;                   <span class="linenum">660</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And therefore he, Gawain, prayed them, both lady alike and knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If they bare goodwill towards him, with their king to behold the fight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For so should it be to their honour. He commended him to them all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who were of his service worthy, for the strife that should there befall!&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No seal did he put to the letter, yet token enough it bare                            <span class="linenum">665</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of him who should be the writer. Quoth Gawain to the footman there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'No longer shalt thou delay thee, the king and the queen abide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the city of Bems by the Korka; seek the queen in the morning-tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the thing she shall bid thee, do thou. But this shalt thou secret hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I in this land am master shall unto no ear be told.                              <span class="linenum">670</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor of this thing be thou forgetful, that thou shalt my servant be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And do thou, without delaying, the errand I give to thee!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the footman from thence he gat him, and Arniv&eacute; she softly went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she asked of him what was his errand? and whither his road was bent?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he quoth, 'Nay, I may not tell thee, for an oath have I sworn to-day,             <span class="linenum">675</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">God keep thee, for I must ride hence!' To the army he took his way.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then wrathful, I ween, was Arniv&eacute; that the messenger said her Nay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor told her aught of his errand, nor whither his journey lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in this wise she quoth to the porter, 'Now, whatever the hour may be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be it day, be it night, when he cometh, send tidings thereof to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In secret would I speak with him; thou art wise, as full well I know!'                  <span class="linenum">5</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet wroth was she still with the footman&mdash;Then she would to the Duchess go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And win from her lips the answer, but ready was she of wit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the name that he bare, her hero, her mouth spake no word of it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gawain he would have her silent, in her hearing his prayer found grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she spake not, nor might Arniv&eacute; learn aught of his name and race.                  <span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the sound as of many trumpets thro' the hall of the palace rang,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And joyful the blasts&mdash;Then rich carpets around on each wall they hang,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no foot but fell on a carpet would it tread on the palace floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A poor man had surely feared him for the riches that there he saw.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a couch they stood there, around the stately hall,                            <span class="linenum">15</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft were they as down, and rich cushions they laid upon each and all.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Gawain with his toil was wearied, and he slept tho' the sun was high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his wounds, with such skill they bound them, tho' his love should beside him lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he in his arms should hold her, he had gotten no hurt I ween.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sounder his daylight's slumber than his sleep of the night had been                <span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When his love had so sorely vexed him; he slept till the vesper bell,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then rich garments of fair silk fashioned, and heavy with broidered gold,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For Gowerzein's Duke shall need them, and Florand, the hero fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in many a land hath he battled, and hath won for him glory's meed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now see that thou make them ready, and do my behest with speed!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he prayed, by a squire, the boatman send hither the captive knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Lischois did he send at his bidding by the hand of his daughter bright.            <span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the maiden Ben&eacute; brought him for the love that she bare Gawain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the good that he vowed to her father that morn when she wept amain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the knight he left her weeping, and rode on his toilsome way&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the highest prize of his manhood it fell to his lot that day.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In all friendship, and then he prayed them beside him to take their seat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till their robes should be brought unto them; and costly they needs must be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For never was fairer raiment than the garb of those heroes three.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For one lived of yore named Sarant, (a city doth bear his name,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From out of the land of Triande in the days that are gone he came.                     <span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Since he wove there a silk with cunning, <i>Saranthasm&eacute;</i> should be its name.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Such robes ware these two and Gawain: then they gat them unto the hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on one side the knights they sat them, on the other the ladies all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he who a woman's beauty had wisdom to judge aright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must reckon Gawain's fair lady the first of these ladies bright.                       <span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the host and his guests so gallant they gazed on her radiant glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they stood before Orgelus&eacute;; and her knights she again must know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her Turkowit, gallant Florand, and Lischois, the young and fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were set free, without let or hindrance, for the love that Gawain must bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the lovely lady of Logrois&mdash;Then their victor they thanked amain,                   <span class="linenum">55</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who was dull to all ill, yet had wisdom in all that might true love gain.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
<span class="i0">As the captives thus free were spoken, Gawain the four queens must see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they stood by the side of the Duchess, and he spake in his courtesy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he bade the two knights go nearer, and with kiss greet those ladies bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The three younger queens, and joyful, I ween, was each gallant knight.                 <span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there was the maiden Ben&eacute;, with Gawain had she sought the hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I think me a joyful welcome she found there from each and all.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the host would no longer stand there, and the twain did he pray to sit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the maidens, as best should please them, and it griev&egrave;d them not one whit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such counsel it grieveth no man! Then the gallant Gawain spake,                        <span class="linenum">65</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Now which of these maids is Itonj&eacute;? Beside her my seat I'ld take!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus in secret he spake to Ben&eacute;, and she showed him the maiden fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'She, with eyes so clear and shining, and red lips, and dusky hair!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wouldst thou speak with the maid in secret? Then thy words be wise and few:'<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Gawain sat him by the maiden, (as I heard so the tale I tell,)<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And well did she know how to bear her as a maiden of high degree.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this question he asked the maiden, if a lover she aye had known?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with wisdom she made him answer, 'To whom might my love be shown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ne'er to a man have I spoken, since the day I first saw the light,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Gawain, he saw well that the maiden would fain to her love belong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet her hatred towards the Duchess as aforetime was fierce and strong;                <span class="linenum">140</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus hatred and love did she bear here, and wrong had he done the maid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who thus, of a true heart simply, her plaint had before him laid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since never a word had he told her how one mother had borne them both,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And King Lot he had been their father&mdash;Then he answered her, little loth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would do what he might to aid her, and in secret with gracious word                <span class="linenum">145</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">She thanked him who brought her comfort, and her sorrow with kindness heard.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now the hour it was come, and they brought there for the tables fair linen white,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The host, and each one of the ladies, their servers were maidens fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the knights who sat over against them many squires did their portion bear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this was the seemly custom, that no squire, in his serving haste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brushed roughly against a maiden, but ever apart they paced&mdash;                         <span class="linenum">160</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whether 'twas wine, or 'twas viands, they offered unto the guests,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And much he rejoiced in their gladness, and his own lot it seemed him sweet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet ever he looked in secret on his lady and love so fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his heart it waxed hot within him, and love's anguish he needs must bear.         <span class="linenum">170</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the day drew near to its closing, and faint waxed the waning light,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When the night would seek for shelter in the realm of departing day;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now many a fair crown golden in the palace hung high o'erhead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with tapers they all were lighted around the stately hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they bare unto every table a host of tapers tall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet the story telleth that the Duchess she was so fair,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Looked well on each other's faces, nor shrank from the glance afraid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If friendship they here desir&egrave;d, or each other would better know,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tho' I wot well there none was a glutton, yet still had they ate their fill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they bare on one side the tables, and Gawain asked, with right goodwill,          <span class="linenum">190</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">If here there should be a fiddler? and many a gallant squire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was skilled on the strings, and gladly would play at the host's desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet were they not all too skilful, and the dances were old alway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not new, as in fair Thuringia the dances they know to-day.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For goodly their dance to look on, and their ranks, with many a pair<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And oft 'twixt two gentle maidens might be seen a noble knight,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And whatever knight bethought him, and would of his lady pray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reward, if for love he served her, none said to his pleading Nay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus they who were poor in sorrow, and rich in joy's fairest dower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sweet words, by sweet lips spoken, made gladsome the passing hour.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And great was the joy of the lady o'er the dance, and the merry feast,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then spake the old Queen Arniv&eacute;, 'Sir Knight, now methinks 'twere best<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Words of love, from his gentle lady must a gracious answer take.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And they drank the night-drink, and sadly to each other they bade goodnight,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But she aided the twain, and Gawain was led of the helpers three<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a chamber fair where his slumber that even should joyful be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two couches alone did he see there, but no man to me hath told<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now betwixt his love and his lady had the joy of Gawain waxed small,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That helped him unto his healing, and the chain of his grief unbound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brought light in the midst of his darkness&mdash;(Breton by his mother's side<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then the squire bent his knee before her, and he gave her a token fair,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They will ask of thee news of venture, but thou, do thou act and speak<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then give to his hand the letter, and swiftly from it he'll read<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy tale, and thy lord's desiring; I doubt not the prayer he'll heed!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Then glad was the squire of her counsel, and he took from the queen his way<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For e'en at the hour of noontide, not in secret but openly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He came to the court, and the courtiers his garments eyed curiously,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they thought that they well beseemed him, and were such as a squire should wear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his horse on each flank was wounded, where the spurs they had smitten fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, e'en as the queen had taught him, he sprang straightway unto the ground,         <span class="linenum">335</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a crowd of eager courtiers pressed, thronging, his steed around.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mantle, sword, and spurs, e'en his charger might be lost, he would little care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he gat thro' the crowd to the heroes, and the knights they besought him there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought he news of some gallant venture? For the custom was aye of yore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That they ate not, nor man nor maiden, save unto the court they bore                  <span class="linenum">340</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The news of some deed of knighthood, and the court might claim its right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If so be 'twas a worthy venture, and one that beseemed a knight.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Quoth the squire, 'Nay, I naught may tell ye, for my haste doth not brook delay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of your courtesy then forgive me, and lead to the king the way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For 'tis meet that I first speak with him, and mine haste it doth work me ill;        <span class="linenum">345</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But my tale shall ye hear, and God teach ye to aid me with right goodwill!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And so did his message urge him he thought not on the thronging crowd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the eyes of the king beheld him, and greeting he spake aloud.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he gave to his hand the letter that bade to King Arthur's heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he read it, two guests, joy and sorrow, alike there the twain had part             <span class="linenum">350</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he spake, 'Hail! the fair day's dawning, by whose light I have read this word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of thee, O son of my sister, true tidings at last have heard!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If in manhood I may but serve thee as kinsman and friend, if faith<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever ruled my heart, 'twill be open to the word that Sir Gawain saith!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he spake to the squire, 'Now tell me if Sir Gawain be glad at heart?'            <span class="linenum">355</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Yea, sire, at thy will, with the joyful I ween shall he have his part,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(And thus quoth the squire in his wisdom,) 'yet his honour he sure shall lose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no man fresh joy may give him, if thine aid thou shalt here refuse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At thy succour his gladness waxeth, and from out of dark sorrow's door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall grief from his heart be banished, if thou hearken his need so sore.             <span class="linenum">360</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As of yore doth he offer service to the queen, and it is his will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the knights of the good Round Table as their comrade account him still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And think on their faith, nor let him be 'spoiled of his honour's meed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But pray thee his cry to hearken, and make to his aid good speed!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quoth King Arthur, 'Dear friend and comrade, bear this letter unto the queen,         <span class="linenum">365</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let her read therein, and tell us why our portion hath twofold been,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at one while we joy and we sorrow. How King Gramoflanz is fain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the pride of his heart, and his malice, to work ill to my knight, Gawain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He thinketh for sure that my nephew shall be Eidegast, whom he slew,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the squire he would pass where a welcome so kindly he did receive,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And with crystal tears run over, as with sweet lips she read so clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The words that within were written, and the need of Gawain they hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his prayer did she read before them; nor long would the squire delay              <span class="linenum">375</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With skill to entreat the ladies, and aid at their hand to pray.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">King Arthur, Sir Gawain's uncle, he wrought with a hearty will<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Guinevere, the wise and the courteous, for she prayed them make no delay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her ladies, but bravely deck them, and get on their stately way.                      <span class="linenum">380</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quoth Kay aloud in his anger, 'If ever I dared believe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That so gallant a man as Gawain of Norway on earth should live<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would cry to him, "Come thou nearer!" Fetch him swift, else he swift will go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a squirrel away he flasheth, and is lost ere his place ye know!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To the queen quoth the squire, 'Now, Lady, my lord must I swiftly seek,               <span class="linenum">385</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His cause do I leave to thine honour!' To her chamberlain did she speak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'See thou that this squire doth rest well, and look well unto his steed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it hewn with spurs, find another, the best that shall serve his need.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what else beside shall fail him, for his dress, or lest pledge he lose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make ready as he shall ask thee, and naught unto him refuse!'                         <span class="linenum">390</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she quoth, 'Thou shalt say unto Gawain, I am ever to serve him fain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy leave from the king will I care for, he greeteth thy lord again!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus the king he was fain for the journey; and the feast it might now be served,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since the right of the good Round Table by this venture was well observed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And joy in their hearts awakened, since this gallant knight Gawain                    <span class="linenum">395</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should be yet in life, and true tidings they might of his welfare gain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the knights of that noble order, that even were glad at heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there sat the king, and those others who had in the ring their part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they sat and they ate with their monarch who fame by their strife had won,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now the squire might betake him homewards, since his errand so well had sped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gat forth at the early dawning, ere the sun should be high o'erhead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the queen's chamberlain he gave him a charger, and robes beside,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And gold lest his pledge be forfeit, and glad on his way he hied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For had he not won from King Arthur what should end his lord's sorrow sore?           <span class="linenum">405</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I know not the days of his journey, but in safety he came once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Ch&acirc;teau Merveil; then joyful was Arniv&eacute;, for as she bade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The porter bare news of his coming, how his steed he no whit had stayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But swiftly had done his errand. Then in secret she made her way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To where by the castle drawbridge the squire did his charger stay,                    <span class="linenum">410</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she asked him much of his journey, and why he in haste must ride?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quoth the squire, ''Tis forbidden, Lady! my errand I needs must hide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An oath have I sworn of silence, and my lord he might well be wroth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If to thee I should tell the tidings, for so should I break mine oath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a fool would he surely hold me! Ask himself what thou fain wouldst learn!'        <span class="linenum">415</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet she strove still with many a question from his purpose the squire to turn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then weary was he of her pleading, and in anger this word he spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Without cause dost thou here delay me, for I think not mine oath to break!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So he went where he found his master, and the Turkowit brave Florand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Lischois, and the lady of Logrois, many ladies did with them stand,               <span class="linenum">420</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the squire made his way to his master, and up stood the knight Gawain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he took him aside, and welcome he bade him in joyful strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Now tell unto me, my comrade, the tidings thou here hast brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thy news be for joy or for sorrow, what speak they of me at court?'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'And say, didst thou find King Arthur?' quoth the squire, 'My master, yea,            <span class="linenum">425</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The king, and the queen, and with them many brave knights I saw alway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they offer to thee their service, and they will at thy bidding come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they heard in such sort thy message, with such gladness, that every one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rich and poor, as one man were joyful when I spake, thou wert safe and well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the folk there were sure a marvel! Their number I may not tell!                   <span class="linenum">430</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Table Round, by thy message, was spread for the feast I ween;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if knight e'er won fame by his valour, then I wot that thy fame hath been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far greater than all who hearkened to the words that I spake of thee,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Tho' from grief did he pass to gladness; yet the squire must his oath abide           <span class="linenum">440</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet for a space keep silence&mdash;Forgotten was all his care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thither he went, and he sat him again by his lady fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with joy he abode in the castle till King Arthur to his relief<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Gawain by the tent of Arthur bade the first maiden take her stand,                    <span class="linenum">685</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the marshal so did his office that the second, to her right hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the third beside the second, should unto each other ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And none of them all delayed them&mdash;So made they a circle wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here the matrons, and there the maidens, and by each of them rode a knight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who would fain do the lady service, and would for her favours fight.                  <span class="linenum">690</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus round the tent of the monarch stood the ladies, a goodly ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to Gawain, the rich in gladness, fair welcome would Arthur bring.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To the ground sprang Gawain and Arniv&eacute;, and her daughters with children twain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Lady of Logrois, and the heroes he o'erthrew on the grassy plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lischois and the gallant Florand; then unto those heroes brave                        <span class="linenum">695</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stepped Arthur from his pavilion, and a kindly welcome gave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the queen, she greeted Gawain, and she welcomed him and his<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of true heart, and from many a lady, I ween, was there many a kiss!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quoth Arthur unto his nephew, 'Say, who shall thy comrades be?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quoth Gawain, 'A kiss of greeting from my lady I fain would see,                      <span class="linenum">700</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twere ill an she should refuse it, for noble are both I ween.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Florand and the Duke of Gowerzein were kissed by the gracious queen.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then into the tent they gat them, and to many the fair field wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was as if it were full of maidens, so close stood they, side by side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then not as the heavy-footed sprang Arthur upon his steed,                            <span class="linenum">705</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he turned to the knights and the ladies in the ring with a kindly heed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he rode from one to the other, and gracious the words he spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the lips of the king so kindly each one must his welcome take.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this was the will of Gawain that no man from hence should ride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till he himself rode with them, but courteous his coming bide.                        <span class="linenum">710</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the king would dismount, and straightway he entered the tent again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he sat him beside his nephew, and straitly he prayed Gawain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To say who were these five ladies, whom hither the knight did bring.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Gawain he looked on the eldest and he spake to the Breton king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Didst thou know Uther Pendragon? 'Tis Arniv&eacute;, his queen and wife,                    <span class="linenum">715</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And well mayst thou look upon her, from the twain didst thou draw thy life.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And there standeth the Queen of Norway, and <i>I</i> am the son she bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And these twain they shall be my sisters; say, are they not maidens fair?'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah! then once again they kissed them, and sorrow and joy were seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all those who looked upon them, from Love this their lot had been;                 <span class="linenum">720</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they laughed, and they cried together, and their lips spake of joy and woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I ween that with tears of gladness their bright eyes must overflow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Arthur he spake to Gawain, 'Nephew, unknown to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is the fifth of these lovely ladies, I prithee who may she be?'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The Duchess, is she, of Logrois,' quoth Gawain in his courtesy,                      <span class="linenum">725</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">'In her service have I come hither, and, so it was told to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou thyself hast sought her dwelling, and how it rejoiced thee there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou canst without shame declare us, as a widower dost thou fare.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quoth Arthur, 'She doth, as her captive, thy kinsman Gaherjet hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Garel, who in many a conflict hath shown h'm a hero bold;                         <span class="linenum">730</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">From my very side was he taken, one charge had we made so nigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That almost we gained the portal, when lo! from the gate did fly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meljanz of Lys! How he battled! On high flew a banner white<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the host who fought beneath it took captive my gallant knight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the banner it bare a blazon of crimson, a bleeding heart,                         <span class="linenum">735</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And right through the midst was it pierced by the shaft of a sable dart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one who to death is smitten&mdash;'Lirivoin' was the battle-cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the army who fought beneath it, and their hand did the victory buy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My nephew, Iofreit, was taken, and grief for his sake I know&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yestreen did I keep the rear-guard, and the chance it hath worked me woe!'            <span class="linenum">740</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sore mourned the king for his sorrow&mdash;quoth the Duchess, with courteous mien,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Sire, I speak thee free of all shaming, I had greeted thee not, I ween.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou mayst well have wrought me evil, tho' no wrong had I done to thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I would that God's wisdom teach thee that harm to make good to me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The knight to whose aid thou camest, if combat with me he dared,                      <span class="linenum">745</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath found me, methinks, defenceless, with side to the foeman bared.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If yet for such strife he lusteth, nor of conflict hath had his fill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With never a sword or a weapon I think to withstand him still.'<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then Gawain, he quoth to King Arthur, 'Wilt thou that we fill the plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With knights? For we well can do so&mdash;I think me such grace to gain                    <span class="linenum">750</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the Duchess that all the captives from thine host she will swiftly free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, many a new spear bearing, her knighthood we here may see.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Yea, such were my will,' quoth Arthur; then the Duchess she gave command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a gallant hero she summoned from Logrois' land&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I wot well a host so goodly the earth ne'er had seen before&mdash;                     <span class="linenum">755</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Gawain, he prayed leave of the monarch, he would to his tent withdraw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the king's will was e'en as Gawain's, and all they who hither rode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the knight, they turned their bridles, and with him in his camp abode.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his tent was so rich and so goodly, as befitted a gallant knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That afar from its costly trappings had poverty taken flight.                         <span class="linenum">760</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And there rode unto his pavilion full many whose hearts were sore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the weary days since he left them, and the love they to Gawain bore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wounds of Kay had been heal&egrave;d since he jousted by Plimiz&ouml;l,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he looked on the wealth of Gawain, and with envy his heart was full,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he quoth, 'Now, King Lot, his father, my monarch's near of kin,                   <span class="linenum">765</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ne'er thought with such pomp to shame us, nor a camp of his own would win.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For ever did he bethink him how Gawain would no vengeance take<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the knight who so sorely smote him, when his right arm in joust he brake,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'God worketh for <i>some</i> His wonders,&mdash;Who gave Gawain this woman folk?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the words they were scarce a friend's words that Kay in his anger spoke.          <span class="linenum">770</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of the honour his friend hath won him the true knight is ever glad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the faithless, aloud he crieth, and his heart ever waxeth sad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the heart of his friend rejoiceth, and he needs must his gladness see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bliss and honour had fallen to Gawain; and, if one would more favoured be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know not what thing he may wish for! Thus ever the evil mind                        <span class="linenum">775</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is with envy filled, while the brave man his comfort and joy doth find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When honour shall seek his comrade, and shame from his face doth flee&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gawain ne'er forgat his knighthood, and from falsehood was ever free;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus it was right and fitting that men on his bliss should gaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gladness and fair rejoicing henceforward should crown his days.                   <span class="linenum">780</span><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In what wise for the folk that followed did the knight of Norway care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alike for his knights and ladies?  Not ill was, methinks, their fare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Arthur and all his people they looked on King Lot's fair son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I trow well they greatly marvelled at the riches his hand had won.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now the evening meal was ended, and 'twas time for the folk to sleep,                 <span class="linenum">785</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And little I grudge their slumber! A guard thro' the night they keep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lo! at the early morning, ere the dawning had waxed to-day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came a folk in goodly armour, and the men of Logrois were they.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they read their helmet's token by the light of the waning moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On this side lay the host of Arthur, and his camp had they passed full soon,          <span class="linenum">790</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they came to the goodly circle where Gawain and his men should lie&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, methinks, who such gallant succour by the might of his hand could buy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were reckoned of men a hero! Then Gawain bade his Marshal find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A place for the host to camp on, but, such was their leader's mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He deemed it best that their circle apart from the rest should be,                    <span class="linenum">795</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And 'twas even the hour of noontide ere all were lodged fittingly.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Arthur, the noble monarch, a message would straightway send;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto Rosche Sabbins, and the city, a squire on his way should wend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To King Gramoflanz should he speak thus, 'Since conflict the king doth pray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he lusteth to fight my nephew, the strife shall he not delay,                     <span class="linenum">800</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Sir Gawain is fain to meet him&mdash;But bid him to meet us here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a gallant man do we know him, were he other, 'twould cost him dear!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the messenger of King Arthur he rode on his errand fain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then forth, with Lischois and Sir Florand, rode the gallant knight, Gawain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he prayed them to show them to him who from many a land afar                      <span class="linenum">805</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had ridden for love's high service, and had fought in his lady's war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he met them and gave them greeting in such wise that the heroes knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sir Gawain for courteous lover, and faithful knight and true.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With that again he left them, and in secret his way he sped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he gat him again to his chamber, and he armed him from foot to head;              <span class="linenum">810</span><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He would know if his wounds were heal&egrave;d so that never a scar should pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his limbs would he test, since so many, both maiden and man were fain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To look on the strife, had they wisdom they should see if his dauntless hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might even to-day, as aforetime, the victor's crown command.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A squire did he bid to bring him his charger, Gringuljet,                             <span class="linenum">815</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he sprang to the saddle lightly and the horse to a gallop set.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would try both himself and his charger, if ready for strife the twain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! woe is me for his journey! so rode he upon the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so had his Fortune willed it, that a knight his bridle drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the side of the river Sabbins, and ye know that knight so true,                    <span class="linenum">820</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a rock, men well might call him, for manhood and courage high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no knight might stand before him, and falsehood his heart did fly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet so weak was his body that no burden it bare of wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, a hand's-breadth had been too heavy, and a finger-length too long!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, I ween, of this gallant hero of old time ye oft must hear,                       <span class="linenum">825</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">If now the gallant Gawain a knightly joust would ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho' never I feared for his honour yet I fear what may now betide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tho' dear be the other's safety yet never a doubt I know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he who in strife would face him an army had found for foe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er far seas, in the land of paynim, his helmet was fashioned fair,                    <span class="linenum">5</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ruby-red was his harness, and the trappings his charger bare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So rode he in search of adventure, and his shield it was pierc&egrave;d thro'&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had plucked for his helm a garland, and the tree where the garland grew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was the tree that Gramoflanz guarded; and Gawain knew the wreath again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he thought, did the king here wait him it were counted to him for shame,           <span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">If hither for strife he had ridden then strife there perforce must be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho' alone were the twain, and no lady the fate of their jousting see.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From Monsalv&auml;sch they came, the chargers, which each of the knights bestrode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they spurred them alike to a gallop, and each 'gainst the other rode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the dewy grass of the meadow, not the sand of the Tourney ring,                     <span class="linenum">15</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should the joust this morn be ridden; and I ween, as their deeds I sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had mourned for the harm of either&mdash;'Twas a fair joust they rode that morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a race that fought fair and knightly was each gallant hero born;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And little had been his winning, great his loss, who there won the prize,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ne'er had he ceased to mourn it, if he were in his calling wise.                   <span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For faith had they pledged to each other, nor of old time, nor yet to-day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had their love and their truth been wounded&mdash;Now hear how they fought the fray:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Swiftly they rode, yet in such wise that each knight must mourn his fate&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For kinsman and knightly brethren, in strength of foeman's hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In strife had come together; and he who this joust should win                          <span class="linenum">25</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His joy were the pledge of sorrow, and his deed must he count for sin&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each right hand it smote so surely that the comrades and foemen twain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With horse and with goodly harness, fell prone on the grassy plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then in such wise they bear them, with their swords such blows they smite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That their shields are hewn and riven, and cloven in deadly fight.                     <span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the splinters of shields, and the grass blades, were mingled upon the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And far other the look of the meadow ere their strife had its ending found;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And too long must they wait for a daysman&mdash;'twas early when first they fought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the hours sped by, and no man an end to their conflict brought,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And no man was there beside them&mdash;Will ye hear how, the self-same day,                 <span class="linenum">35</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">King Arthur's knights to the army of King Gramoflanz made their way?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a plain by the sea he camped him&mdash;On the one side of the ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flowed the Sabbins, and over against it the Poinzacleins its ending found.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the host on the plain lay stretching its length for a mile and more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And half a mile broad had they deemed it&mdash;As the messengers toward it bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many unknown knights rode forward, archers, squires, with arms and spear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And behind them, with waving banners, did the mighty host draw near.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And, if I may tell the story, the tidings I fain would bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of those who had ridden hither, and camped on the sward so green,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But sorely it vexed the Duchess, that she, too, must kiss this knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who little had cared for her kisses, nor would for her favours fight&mdash;                <span class="linenum">280</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho' her lands and her love she proffered when he before Logrois fought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she rode far to overtake him&mdash;thus shame in her anger wrought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the others they spake him gently, with never a thought of wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till shame from his heart was driven, and joy in its stead waxed strong.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Gawain of right and reason, if Ben&eacute; his grace would hold,                        <span class="linenum">285</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bade her seal her lips to silence, to her lady no word be told,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">My honour so sore was wounded that it well-nigh to earth was cast;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">True friendship and brotherhood with me, and from whom I must part in shame?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then all with one voice they spake there&mdash;He had won for himself such fame<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That, tho' wide was the tent of Gawain, he thought best that in all men's eyes<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He should sit without on the meadow, and the knights they should sit around,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Would ye know who was this and that one? The tale it were all too long<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Who were they who so well were arm&egrave;d, and showed them such men of might<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Who had followed King Arthur hither&mdash;If each one, his land and kin,                   <span class="linenum">345</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I named in their rightful order 'twere ill to the end to win!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all men they spake together, there was none there like Parzival,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his face and his form so lovely many women might love him well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nothing there failed unto him of aught that beseemed a knight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who beareth the crown of honour, and fighteth a goodly fight.                         <span class="linenum">350</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Gamuret's son upstood there, and he spake, 'Ye who shall be here<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A strange and a hidden wonder it drave me from out your band&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye who brotherhood once have sworn me, and in friendship have clasped my hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now help me, by this your knighthood, mine honour to win again!'                      <span class="linenum">355</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gladly would Arthur grant him that for which his desire was fain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then aside with few folk he stepped him, and straitly he prayed this grace,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And for that he of need must fight me&mdash;For conflict I sought his land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for nothing else came I hither but to fight with his strong right hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought not I here should find thee, my cousin, it grieves me sore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this king did I surely take thee, who never from strife forbore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now let me, I prithee, fight him; if ever he know defeat                              <span class="linenum">365</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">My hand shall such lesson teach him as he findeth not over sweet!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They have given me back mine honour, and thy brother knight am I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thy kinsman true, fair cousin, so grant to me, cousinly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That this combat be mine&mdash;I swear thee for us twain will I face the foe,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quoth Gawain, 'In the court of King Arthur have I many a brother dear,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">My cause is so good, I think me, that Fate so shall rule the fight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I stand at the last the victor, tho' my foe be a man of might.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God reward thee that thou, of thy kindness, this conflict for me wouldst face,        <span class="linenum">375</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the day is not yet in its dawning when another may take my place!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now Arthur the prayer had hearkened, of their speech he an end would make,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more in the ring beside them his seat did the monarch take.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the cup-bearers did not tarry, the noble youths they bare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many golden cups so precious, and wroughten with jewels fair,                         <span class="linenum">380</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor one alone could fill them&mdash;and when their task was o'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The folk uprose, and gat them each one to his rest once more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And night-fall had come upon them&mdash;Naught did Parzival delay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he wrought in such wise that his harness might be ready ere break of day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were a strap or a fastening broken, of that did he have good care,                    <span class="linenum">385</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he bade them look well unto it, that all should be fit and fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a shield new and strong must they bring him, for his own, in many a fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With many a blow was cloven, and they brought him a shield of might;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the serving-men who bare it, they knew not the knight, I trow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Frenchmen were some among them, as the venture doth bid ye know.                  <span class="linenum">390</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the steed that erewhile to jousting the Knight of the Grail must bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that did a squire bethink him, and ne'er might it better fare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now 'twas the hour for slumber, and the night had o'ercome the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Parzival slept, and before him all ready his armour lay.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And King Gramoflanz, he rued it that the day such chance had brought                  <span class="linenum">395</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That another man in his presence for the sake of his garland fought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor his folk might still his longing for the strife that the morn should bring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the thought, that he had delayed him, full sorely it vexed the king.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What, then, should the hero do here? Since honour he sought and fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He scarce might await the dawning, and the strife that with daylight came,            <span class="linenum">400</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ere sunrise himself and his charger were clad all in harness rare&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did women, with wealth o'erburdened, the cost of his decking share?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wot that, without their aiding, it costly and fair should be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the sake of a maid did he deck him, in her service no laggard he!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
<span class="i0">So he rode hence to seek his foeman, and sorely it vexed the king                     <span class="linenum">405</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the early light of the morning Sir Gawain had failed to bring.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now, unknown unto all, in secret stole Parzival from the court,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he stripped of its floating pennon a strong spear from Angram brought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fully armed was the hero, and lonely he took his way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the posts round the ring of battle shone fair in the dawning day.               <span class="linenum">410</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he saw the king await him, and ere ever a word they spake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men say that they smote each other thro' the shield, and the spear-shafts brake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from either hand the splinters flew high in the summer air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For skilled were they both in jousting, and their swords they right well might bear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dew was brushed from the meadow, and the helmets felt many a blow             <span class="linenum">415</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the edge of the blades keen-tempered, no faltering might either know.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the grass underfoot was trodden, and the dew-drops in many a place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swept away, and I needs must mourn here the red blossoms' vanished grace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet more do I mourn for the heroes, and their toil without thought of fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And who with unmixed rejoicing, the tale of their strife should hear             <span class="linenum">420</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whom they had ne'er done evil?&mdash;Then Gawain must himself prepare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the toil and the stress of battle, and the peril he thought to dare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And 'twas even the midst of the morning ere of all men the tale was told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his tent was Parzival missing, and they sought for the hero bold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did he think to make peace? Nay, his bearing spake little, methinks, of peace,        <span class="linenum">425</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he fought as a man, and 'twas noontide ere ever the strife might cease.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A bishop sang Mass for Gawain, and the folk they stood thick around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a knight and lady on horseback might there be found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without the tent of King Arthur, ere the Mass to an end they sing&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the priest did his holy office, beside him there stood the king;                <span class="linenum">430</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he spake the Benediction, then Gawain armed himself for fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And greaves of iron, well wroughten, they did on his limbs of might.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then uprose a voice of wailing from the women, and one and all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The host rode forth to the meadow; and lo! there did strife befall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they heard the clash of the sword-blades, and they saw the fire-sparks fly        <span class="linenum">435</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the helmets as there the foemen their blows with fierce strength did ply.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
<span class="i0">King Gramoflanz oft had boasted he would scorn with <i>one</i> man to fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He thought here that <i>six</i> were his foemen, and each one a valiant knight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet none but Parzival faced him, and he fought in such gallant wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he taught to the king a lesson which men e'en to-day may prize;                  <span class="linenum">440</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in his own praise his own lips should speak never more this tale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He could fight and could conquer <i>two</i> men, since o'er <i>one</i> he might not prevail.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From left and from right came the armies, o'er the grassy plain so wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, each one their station keeping, they halted on either side,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And afoot on the ground they battled with sword-blades, the heroes good.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sharp and sore was the conflict, and steadfast the twain did stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their swords on high they tossed them, and oft did the blades change hands.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now Gramoflanz reaped sore payment for the garland from off his tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the kinsman of his fair lady should the strife none too easy be.                   <span class="linenum">450</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His kinship with fair Itonj&eacute; had stood Parzival in good stead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If right might have claimed a hearing, yet was not his strife ill-sped.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they who much fame had won them, again for fair fame would fight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one strove for the sake of his kinsman, and one for his lady bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he did but Frau Minne's bidding, as was meet for her vassal true&mdash;                <span class="linenum">455</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now uprode the gallant Gawain, and e'en as he nearer drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The conflict was nigh its ending, and the Waleis should victor be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, bareheaded, unto the battle, there hastened those heroes three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brandelidelein of Punturtois, and Count Bernard of Riviers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the third knight who rode beside them was Affinamus of Clitiers.                  <span class="linenum">460</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the army over against them came King Arthur beside Gawain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the two knights, with battle wearied, they rode o'er the grassy plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the five they thought them 'twas time that the strife should end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Gramoflanz must confess here that no longer he might contend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his own mouth proclaimed him vanquished, and his foeman had won the day&mdash;         <span class="linenum">465</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the folk who had seen the combat might never his word gainsay!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Quoth Gawain, 'Nay, it nothing grieves me, my cousin's gallant deed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-morrow is all too early if this combat I needs must face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An the king would withdraw his challenge I would count it to him for grace.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To the camp rode the mighty army, there were many ladies fair,                        <span class="linenum">485</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a knight in armour, and costly the arms they bare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I ween that never an army was so richly decked before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the knights of the good Round Table, and the men of the Duchess wore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair surcoats richly blazoned, of silk from Zinidunt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bright was their outer garments, and brought from far Pelpiunt.                   <span class="linenum">490</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the heroes in either army spake ever of Parzival,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their lips, in such wise they praised him, that his friends it rejoiced them well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the men of Gramoflanz spake thus, that never the sun had shone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a knight who fought so bravely, or such gallant deeds had done;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whatever feats of knighthood had been wrought on either side,                     <span class="linenum">495</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet he, o'er all other heroes, the victor should still abide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet they knew not of whom they spake thus, nay, neither his race or name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho' the army it rang with his praises, and no mouth but declared his fame.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Gramoflanz did they counsel, King Arthur he well might pray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To take good heed to his army that no knight from his ranks should stray              <span class="linenum">500</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For combat, as e'en that morning, but to send unto him <i>one</i> knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The son of King Lot, Sir Gawain, for with <i>him</i> had he come to fight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And straightway he sent the message by two courtly lads and wise,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And he spake, 'Now look well for the maiden who is fairest in all men's eyes,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ye shall see in what wise she bear her, if joyful, or sad at heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye shall prove these her ways in secret, in her eyes ye right well may see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If yet for a friend she mourneth; and this too your task shall be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye shall give to my friend, fair Ben&eacute;, this letter and golden ring,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In the other camp, the meanwhile, did Itonj&eacute; the tidings hear<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The fairest knight that a maiden within her heart might hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would fight, the one with the other, and their hand might no man withhold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then her maiden shame it yielded to the flood of her grief so sore,                   <span class="linenum">515</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And none shall rejoice at her sorrow, for the pain undeserved she bore.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then her mother and Queen Arniv&eacute; they led the maid aside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a tent so small and silken, and Arniv&eacute; her grief would chide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she bade her cease her weeping&mdash;There was naught that the maid might say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to speak aloud the secret she hid in her heart alway;                             <span class="linenum">520</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then out quoth the royal maiden, 'Of my brother shall he be slain<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A bitter death shall it bring me, the hand that my love doth kill&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sir King, thou shalt mourn my sorrow, and I think not that such thy will,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spake the fair maid unto King Arthur, 'Forget not that thou shalt be<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quoth Arthur aloud in his wisdom, 'Alas, thou fair niece of mine,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Did he ne'er, in a joyful moment, thy fair face and sweet lips behold?'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">And tokens true have I sent him, that no doubt should betwixt us lie&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No falsehood my king's heart ruleth, but he loveth me steadfastly!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the maiden Ben&eacute; saw them, and knew them, the squires twain<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Why she sorrowed, and this their errand they fain to the king would tell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they asked of the maiden Ben&eacute; if she their friend would be?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thou hast found her! For she shall be like him who so knightly doth play his part,    <span class="linenum">710</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nor might he take vengeance on her, since guiltless this woe she bore.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now many were sorely angered that I told not this tale afore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since it wearied them naught in the hearing&mdash;Now my words I withhold no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I give ye to wit full truly, as my mouth may the story tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The end of this wondrous venture for methinks it shall please ye well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye shall know how the king, Anfortas, of his wound was made whole again&mdash;               <span class="linenum">5</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the queen doth the venture tell us, who in far Pelrap&auml;r did reign;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How she kept a pure heart and loyal till the day of her great reward,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And earth's fairest crown was her guerdon at the hand of her faithful lord.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye shall hear the tale of its winning, if my skill fail me not alway;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet first must ye list the labour that Parzival wrought that day.                      <span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now, tho' dauntless his hand had striven, but as children his foemen all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ne'er would I risk my hero might I rule that which shall befall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I must sorrow sore for his peril, and fain would I speak him free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now must I trust that Good Fortune the shield of his heart may be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For purity, and high courage, side by side in his heart they lay,                      <span class="linenum">15</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ne'er had he cherished cowardice, nor shrunk from the knightly fray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I deem this shall surely give him such strength he his life may hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since fierce strife draweth nigh unto him, and his foe is a hero bold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he meeteth a prince of battles who dauntless to strife doth ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And unbaptized was the foeman who rode here in his heathen pride.                      <span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Full soon had he come, our hero, to a mighty woodland shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And without, in the light of the dawning, his armour a knight displayed.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
<span class="i0">'Twere a marvel could I, a poor man, of the riches now speak to ye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the heathen he bare as his decking, so costly their worth should be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If more than enough I told ye, yet more would be left to tell;                         <span class="linenum">25</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet I would not his wealth were hidden&mdash;What of riches, I ween, shall dwell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Bretagne alike and England, and be tribute to Arthur's might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They had paid not the stones that, shining, glowed fair on his armour bright.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His blazoned coat was costly, and naught but the truth I say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ruby and Chalcedony, ye had held them not fair that day.                               <span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bright as the sun was his vesture, on the mount of Agremontein,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the glowing fires, Salamanders had welded that garment's shine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There jewels rare and precious, with never a fault or flaw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glowed dark and light; of their nature, I ween, I can tell no more!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His desire was for love's rewarding, and the winning of high renown,                   <span class="linenum">35</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had won from the hands of fair women the jewels that his pride did crown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the favour Frau Minne showed him with joy did his proud heart beat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it swelled high with manly courage, as is for a lover meet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As reward for his deeds of knighthood on his helmet a beast he bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ecidemon, all poisonous serpents they must of its power beware,                        <span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For of life and of strength doth it rob them, if they smell it but from afar&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thopedissimont&eacute;, Assigarziont&eacute;, Thasm&eacute;, and Arabia,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They scarce of such silk might boast them as was covering for his steed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sought, that mighty heathen, in a woman's love his meed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And therefore he bravely decked him, and fain would his courage prove,                 <span class="linenum">45</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his manhood, it urged him onward to battle for sake of love.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now the knight, so young and gallant, in a haven beside the wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But little known, on the water had anchored his ships so good.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his armies were five-and-twenty, and they knew not each other's speech&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas a token fair of his riches, and the lands that his power might reach,            <span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the armies, so were the kingdoms that did service unto his hand&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Moors and Saracens were they, and unlike was each warlike band,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the hue of their skins was diverse&mdash;Thus gathered from lands afar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye might see in his mighty army strange weapons of heathen war.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So thus, in search of adventure, from his army this man would ride,                    <span class="linenum">55</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the woodland green he wandered, and waited what should betide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And since thus it well doth please them, so let them ride, these kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone, in search of ventures, and the fair fame that combat brings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet Parzival rode not lonely, methinks he had comrades twain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself, and the lofty courage that lord o'er his soul did reign.                      <span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that he so bravely fought here might win from a woman praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If falsehood should not mislead her, that injustice should rule her ways.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So spurred they against each other, who were lambs in their purity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet as lions were they bold and dauntless, 'twas a sight for a man to see!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! woe is me for their meeting, for the world and its ways are wide,                  <span class="linenum">65</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they well might have spared each other, nor, guiltless, to battle ride.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I should sorrow for him whom I brought here, save my heart did this comfort hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the Grail shall with strength endue him, and Love shelter the hero bold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since he was of the twain the servant, nor his heart ever wavering knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ever his hand was ready to serve them with service true.                           <span class="linenum">70</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My skill little wit doth give me this combat that here befell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fitting words and knightly, from beginning to end to tell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the eye of each flashed triumph as the coming foe he saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the heart of each knight waxed joyful, as they nearer to battle draw.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet sorrow, I ween, was nigh them, true hearts, from all falsehood free,               <span class="linenum">75</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each bare the heart of the other, and should comrade and stranger be!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nor may I asunder part them, the paynim and Christian knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hatred they show to each other, tho' no cause have they here for fight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And methinks this of joy shall rob them, who, as true women, share their pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who risk their lives for a woman! May they part, ere one here be slain!                <span class="linenum">80</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As the lion-cub, that its mother beareth dead, doth to life awake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the aweful voice of its father, so these twain, as the spear-shafts break<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arouse to fresh life, and to honour, I ween, are they newly born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For many a joust have they ridden and many a spear outworn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they tighten the hanging bridle, and they take to their aim good care,            <span class="linenum">85</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That each on the shield of the other, as he willeth, shall smite him fair.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And no point do they leave unguarded, and they give to their seat good heed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As men who are skilled in jousting, and sharply each spurs his steed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And bravely the joust was ridden, and each gorget asunder broke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the spears bent not, but in splinters they flew from each mighty stroke;           <span class="linenum">90</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sore was he wroth, the heathen, that this man might his joust abide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For never a knight but had fallen who a course 'gainst his spear would ride.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Think ye that their swords they wielded as their chargers together drew?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, the combat was sharp and bitter, and each must give proof anew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alike of his skill and his manhood&mdash;The strange beast, Ecidemon,                       <span class="linenum">95</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had many a wound, and beneath it the helmet sore blows had won;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the horses were hot and wearied, and many new turns they tried&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then down they sprung from their chargers, and their sword-blades afresh they plied.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the heathen wrought woe to the Christian, 'Thasm&eacute;!' was his battle-cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when 'Tabronit!' he shouted he drew ever a step anigh.                            <span class="linenum">100</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Christian, he showed his valour in many an onslaught bold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So pressed they upon each other&mdash;Nor would I the tale withhold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of how the fight was foughten, yet must I the strife bemoan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How, one flesh and one blood thus sharing, each wrought evil unto his own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For both were the sons of one father, and brothers, I ween, were they,                <span class="linenum">105</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And methinks upon such foundation faith and friendship their stone should lay!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And love ne'er had failed the heathen, and his heart was for combat fain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the love of Queen Sekundill&eacute; fresh honour he thought to gain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tribalibot's land she gave him, and she was his shield in strife&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So bravely he fought, how think ye that the Christian might guard his life?           <span class="linenum">110</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">On love let his thoughts be steadfast, else sure is he here undone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he hath from the hand of the heathen in this combat his death-blow won.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O thou Grail, by thy lofty virtue such fate from thy knight withhold!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kondwiramur, thine husband in such deadly stress behold!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here he standeth, of both the servant, in such danger and peril sore                  <span class="linenum">115</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That as naught ye may count the ventures he hath dared for your sake of yore!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then on high flashed the sword of the heathen, and many such blow had slain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his knee Parzival was beaten&mdash;Now see how they fought, the twain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If twain ye will still account them, yet in sooth shall they be but one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For my brother and I are one body, e'en as husband and wife are one!                  <span class="linenum">120</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The heathen wrought woe to the Christian&mdash;Of Asbestos, I ween, his shield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wondrous wood that never to flame or decay shall yield;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I' sooth, right well she loved him who gave him a gift so fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turquoise, Chrysoprase, Emerald, Ruby, rich jewels beyond compare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Decked with shining lines its surface, on the boss shone a precious stone,            <span class="linenum">125</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Antrax, afar they call it, as Carbuncle it here is known.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as token of love, for his guarding, Sekundill&eacute; the queen would give<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wondrous beast, Ecidemon&mdash;in her favour he fain would live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And e'en as she willed he bare it, as his badge, did that gallant knight&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here with purity faith joined issue, and truth with high truth would fight.           <span class="linenum">130</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For love's sake upon the issue of this combat each risked his life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each had pledged his hand to the winning of honour and fame in strife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Christian, in God he trusted since the day that he rode away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the hermit, whose faithful counsel had bidden him trust alway<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Him who could turn his sorrow into bliss without thought of bale&mdash;                 <span class="linenum">135</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Him should he pray for succour, whose succour should never fail.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And fierce and strong was the heathen, when 'Tabronit,' he cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For there, 'neath the mount Kaukasus did the queen, Sekundill&eacute;', abide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus gained he afresh high courage 'gainst him who ne'er knew of yore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The weight of such deadly combat, for in sooth was he pressed full sore&mdash;             <span class="linenum">140</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To defeat was he aye a stranger, and ne'er had he seen its face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho' his foemen right well must know it, as they yielded them to his grace!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With skill do they wield their weapons, and sparks spring from the helmets fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a whistling wind ariseth as the blades cleave the summer air;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For had they but known each other their stake ne'er had been so great,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For he who shall here be victor, if true brother and knight he be,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sir Parzival, why delay thee to think on thy queen and wife,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The one, in his strong heart, steadfast, lay ever a love so true;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the other, the precious jewels that burnt with a mystic glow,                     <span class="linenum">155</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thro' whose virtue his strength waxed greater, and his heart must fresh courage know.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it grieveth me sore that the Christian was weary and faint with fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor swiftly might he avoid him, and his blows they were robbed of might;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if the twain fail to aid thee, O thou gallant Parzival,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Each one a hundred marks' worth&mdash;and the sword so strong and keen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Ither of Gaheviess bare first brake sheer on the helmet's sheen,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And a gallant knight was the heathen, and he spake out, right courteously,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Tho' the tongue was the tongue of a heathen yet in fair French his speech should be,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Now I see well, thou gallant hero, thou hast no sword wherewith to fight,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sore strife shall have been your comrade, both thine and thy brother's too!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, with whom did ye fight so fiercely?' Then Parzival spake anew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'No fiercer fight have I foughten, my brother's hand pressed me sore                  <span class="linenum">415</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To defend me, no charm more potent than defence 'gainst death's stroke I bore.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yet no fear did he show, and 'vantage he scorned of mischance to gain,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But now have I won his friendship, and his love, and with right goodwill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would I do to him faithful service as befitteth a brother still!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Gawain spake, 'They brought me tidings of a dauntless strife and bold,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And long, and wide, and silken, were the clothes that above them went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the store of Klingsor's riches they spread forth within the tent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then four costly carpets silken, and woven so fair to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did they hang one against the other, so the tale it was told to me;                   <span class="linenum">440</span><br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And he who should bear the tidings, he was Iofreit, and Idol's son;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Her mantle was costly velvet, and blacker, I ween, its hue<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With turtle-doves, all shining, the badge of the Grail were they.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they looked and they marvelled at her as toward them she made her way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For swiftly she came, and her head-gear was high and white, her face                  <span class="linenum">725</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With many a veil was shrouded, and her features no man might trace.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then with even pace and seemly she rode o'er the turf so green,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No fool was she, but wise maiden&mdash;So rode she around the ring,                        <span class="linenum">730</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they showed her where sat King Arthur, nor her greeting should fail that day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In French was her speech, and in this wise the monarch she fain would pray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They should wreak not on her their vengeance for the words that she spake of yore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But hearken unto her message since welcome the news she bore.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then to Parzival she turned her, since his place by the king's was found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she stayed not, but down from her charger she sprang swiftly unto the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with courteous mien, as beseemed her, fell low at the hero's feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, weeping, she prayed that in friendship her coming he now would greet,            <span class="linenum">740</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forget his wrath against her, and forgive her without a kiss.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they joined to her prayer their pleadings, King Arthur and Feirefis.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a sooth Parzival must hate her, yet he hearkened to friendship's prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of true heart and free forgave her&mdash;Tho' I say not the maid was fair,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And thanked those who had won her pardon for the wrong she had done the knight.<br /></span>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>

<p>Book <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> tells of the sorrow of Anfortas and his knights; how he prayed
them to kill him, and how he would fain have withheld his eyes from the
light of the Grail; of the coming of Parzival and Feirefis, and of the
healing of Anfortas.</p>

<p>How Parzival set forth to meet his wife on the shores of Plimiz&ouml;l; and
how Trevrezent confessed to having spoken falsely in order to withhold
him from the Quest.</p>

<p>Of the joyful meeting of Parzival and Kondwiramur; and how Kardeiss
was proclaimed king of Brobarz, Waleis, Norgals, and Anjou; and how
Parzival with Kondwiramur and Lohengrin rode to Monsalv&auml;sch. How
on their way they found Sigun&eacute; dead, and buried her by her lover.</p>

<p>Of the great feast at Monsalv&auml;sch; and how Feirefis failed to behold
the Grail, and of his love for R&eacute;panse de Schoie. How Feirefis was
baptized, and wedded R&eacute;panse de Schoie; how the twain set forth for
Feirefis' kingdom, and of their son, Prester John. Of Lohengrin and the
Duchess of Brabant; how he was sent to her aid from Monsalv&auml;sch, and
dwelt with her in peace till she asked the question which drove him forth.</p>

<p>The poet blames Chr&ecirc;tien de Troyes for having done the tale a wrong;
it was Kiot who taught the song aright, to its very end. He, Wolfram
of Eschenbach, will speak no more of it, but he prays that all good and
gracious women will praise him for his song, since he sang it to pleasure
a woman.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now Anfortas and his Templars they suffered sore grief and pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their true love in bondage held him, since he prayed them for death in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in sooth death had been his portion, save they wrought that the Grail he saw&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the might of Its mystic virtue fresh life must he ever draw.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he spake to the knights of Monsalv&auml;sch, 'Of a sooth, were ye true of heart,        <span class="linenum">5</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye had pitied ere this my sorrow, how long shall pain be my part?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If reward ye would have as deserving, then God give ye payment fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ever was <i>I</i> your servant since the days that I harness bare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Atonement in full have I made here for aught I have done of wrong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To ye, e'en tho' none had known it, and my penance endureth long!                      <span class="linenum">10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">If ye would not be held unfaithful, by the helmet and shield I bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bond of our common knighthood, release me from bondage sore!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this of a truth must ye grant me, if ye do not the truth disdain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bare <i>both</i> as a knight undaunted, and fame thro' my deeds did gain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For hill and vale have I ridden, and many a joust have run,                            <span class="linenum">15</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with sword-play good from my foemen much hatred methinks, I won.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet with ye doth that count for little! Bereft of all joy am I;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, cometh the Day of Judgment, my voice would I lift on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in God's sight, I, one man only, at the last will accuse ye all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If freedom ye fail to give me, and to Hell shall ye surely fall!                       <span class="linenum">20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in sooth ye should mourn my sorrow&mdash;From the first have ye seen the thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ye know how it came upon me&mdash;Now I profit ye not as king,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And all too soon will ye think so, when thro' me ye have lost your soul&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! why thus ill-entreat me? Ere this had I been made whole!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the knights from his grief had freed him, save they hope from the word must draw   <span class="linenum">25</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Trevrezent spake of aforetime, and that writ on the Grail he saw.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And once more would they wait his coming whose joy there had waxen weak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the hour that should bring them healing from the question his lips should speak.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the king of a wile bethought him, and fast would he close his eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And four days long so he held them, when the knights, in their 'customedwise,          <span class="linenum">30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the Grail would bear him, if he said them or yea, or nay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But his weakness so wrought upon him, as before the shrine he lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That his eyelids he needs must open, and against his will must live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the Grail held death far from him and fresh life must Its vision give.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And so was it with Anfortas till the day when Parzival                                 <span class="linenum">35</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Feirefis his brother, rode swift to Monsalv&auml;sch' hall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the time was near when the planet, its course in high heaven run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mars or Jupiter, glowing wrathful, its station had well-nigh won,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the spot whence it took its journey&mdash;Ah! then was an evil day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wrought ill to the wound of Anfortas, and the torment would have its way;         <span class="linenum">40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And maiden and knight must hearken as the palace rang with his cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the help that no man might give him he besought with despairing eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For past all aid was he wounded, and his knights could but share his grief&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the tale saith he drew ever nearer who should bring him alone relief.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then oft as the bitter anguish in its bondage the hero held,                           <span class="linenum">45</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The taint of the wound to banish, the hall was with sweetness filled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For before him they spread on the carpet Terebinth, and odours fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of aromatic spices and sweet woods filled the scented air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Teriak and precious Ambra, and methinks that their smell was sweet&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cardamom, Jeroffel, Muscat, lay broken beneath the feet                                <span class="linenum">50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where'er one set foot on the carpet; and e'en as each footstep fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their perfume arose, and their freshness, of the venom o'ercame the smell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his fire was of Lignum aloe, as methinks ye have heard afore&mdash;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of the horny skin of the viper had they fashioned the pillars four<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That stood 'neath his couch&mdash;'Gainst the venom must his knights on the cushions strew  <span class="linenum">55</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Powder of roots so precious, whose healing scent they knew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well stuffed, but unsewed, was the covering against which the monarch leant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the silk and the mattress 'neath it were of Palm&acirc;t of Nouriente.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the couch itself was yet richer, with many a precious stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was it decked, nor were others found there save the rarest of jewels alone;            <span class="linenum">60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by Salamanders woven were the cords which the bed did bind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea even the fastening 'neath it&mdash;Yet no joy might Anfortas find.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The couch on all sides was costly, (no man shall contend I ween<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he in the days of his lifetime a richer shall e'er have seen,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas precious alone from the virtue of the jewels and their magic power,              <span class="linenum">65</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Parzival, with the maid and his brother, nor in truth did I ever hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The distance these three had journeyed ere they drew to the Burg anear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But conflict had been their portion had Kondrie not been their guide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But afar from all strife did she hold them, and in peace on their way they ride.       <span class="linenum">90</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So came they at length to an outpost&mdash;Then swiftly towards them sped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many Templars well armed and mounted, and right soon they the truth had read,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they knew by the guide that succour at last to their walls should draw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Captain he spake out gladly as the Turtle-doves he saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleam fair on Kondrie's vesture, 'Now an end hath it found, our grief,                 <span class="linenum">95</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the sign of the Grail he cometh who shall bring to our king relief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The knight we have looked and have longed for since the dawn of our sorrow's day&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stand ye still, for great gladness cometh, and our mourning is past away!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Feirefis Angevin would urge him, his brother, to joust to ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Kondrie, she grasped his bridle, lest conflict should there betide,               <span class="linenum">100</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the maiden, true but unlovely, spake thus unto Parzival,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Shield and banner, thou sure shouldst know them, of the Grail are these heroes all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ready to do thee service.' Then out spake the heathen bold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'If so it shall be, from battle mine hand may I well withhold.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Parzival prayed that Kondrie would ride forward, the knights to meet,            <span class="linenum">105</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she rode, and she spake of the gladness that neared them with flying feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, one and all, the Templars sprang straightway unto the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from off their head the helmet in the self-same hour unbound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Parzival they greeted, and they were in his greeting blest,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And then with the twain to Monsalv&auml;sch the Templars they took their way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though they wept, yet methinks that gladness was the fount of their tears that day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And a countless folk they found there, many grey-haired knights and old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pages of noble bearing, and of servants, a host untold.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And sad were the folk and mournful, whom their coming might well rejoice,             <span class="linenum">115</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Parzival and his brother they welcomed with friendly voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kindly did they receive them, without, in the palace court,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the foot of the noble stairway, and the knights to the hall they brought.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And, e'en as was there the custom, a hundred carpets round,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And each couch bare a velvet covering, and methinks, if the twain had wit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The while that the squires disarmed them 'twould pleasure them there to sit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a chamberlain came towards them, and he brought to them vesture fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each should be clad as the other, and many a knight sat there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they bare many precious vessels of gold, (none I ween was glass,)                 <span class="linenum">125</span><br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And this have ye heard of aforetime, how he lay, for he scarce might sit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the couch and its goodly decking, forsooth have ye read of it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the twain did Anfortas welcome with gladness, and yet with grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he spake, 'O'er-long have I waited tho' I win from thine hand relief;             <span class="linenum">130</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a while ago didst thou leave me in such wise, art thou true of heart,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A stranger shall be thy comrade, and I think it an evil thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thus he doth stand before me, say wherefore no thought dost take<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Now say where the Grail It lieth? If God's mercy He think to show,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Had she come unto Terre de Salv&auml;sch and the wood where they fought of old;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where in joust Segramor had fallen, and her lord did her likeness know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the threefold blood-drops mystic, on the white of the drifted snow.                <span class="linenum">170</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">To Trevrezent did he ride first, and he told him the wondrous tale;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his heart was the hermit joyful that it thus with Anfortas stood,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">By God's will, and besought His favour, till their penance at last did end.           <span class="linenum">190</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But God to Himself is faithful, and ne'er doth He changing know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor to them whom I named as forgiven did He ever forgiveness show.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they who refuse His service, He Himself will, I ween, refuse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I wot they are lost for ever, and that fate they themselves did choose.<br /></span>

<h2>APPENDICES</h2>

<h3>EXCURSUS A<br />

WOLFRAM'S SOURCE</h3>

<p>In examining into the source whence Wolfram derived this poem, it may be well to
restate briefly the problem as indicated in the Preface. We may take it as an acknowledged
fact, disputed by none, that for the bulk of his work, from the commencement of
Books <span class="smcap">III.</span> to <span class="smcap">XIII.</span>, and inclusive of part of the latter, Wolfram drew from a French
source; he himself says that this source was the poem of 'Kiot the Proven&ccedil;al,' and, while
acquainted with the work of Chr&ecirc;tien de Troyes, he distinctly avows his preference for
Kiot over Chr&ecirc;tien, saying that Chr&ecirc;tien had told the story wrongly, for which Kiot might
well be wrathful with him. From this we gather that, granting the existence of the two
French versions, Kiot's had preceded Chr&ecirc;tien's.</p>

<p>The difficulties in the way of accepting Wolfram's own definite statement are twofold:
first, that no trace of such a poem, or such a poet, exists (which in itself is not an
insuperable difficulty); second, and more serious, that we do possess the poem of Chr&ecirc;tien
de Troyes, and that it presents such striking features of similarity to Wolfram's version
that it is clear that if one were not the source of the other, there is a common source at
the root of both.</p>

<p>Now, of Chr&ecirc;tien's source he only tells us that Count Philip of Flanders gave him the
book in which he found this story of Perceval and the Grail, but of the author of the book
he says no word. Of Kiot's source, Wolfram tells us that the story of the origin of the
Grail was found in a <span class="smcap">MS.</span> at Toledo, written in Arabic by a heathen astronomer,
Flegetanis; and it also appears, from a passage in Book <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> p. 238, that the story of
Parzival was contained in the same <span class="smcap">MS.</span> That Kiot then sought through the chronicles
of various countries for some confirmation of the tale, and finally found the record of the
Grail kings in the chronicles of Anjou.</p>

<p>Of the sources thus variously given, the book possessed by Count Philip of Flanders,
the Arabic <span class="smcap">MS.</span> of Flegetanis, the Chronicles of Anjou, and Kiot's poem founded upon
these two last, the Chronicles of Anjou alone remain to us; do they throw any light on
the question or not? It has long been asserted that they do <i>not</i>, and it is true that they
contain no record of the Grail kings, nor, though King Arthur is mentioned, and treated
as an historical personage, do we find any mention of Mazadan, Gamuret, Herzeleide,
and Parzival under the same names; but it also seems equally clear that the writer of the
<i>Parzival</i> knew the Chronicles of Anjou, and in the case of each of the characters mentioned
above it is not difficult to trace a distinct correspondence between what is recorded
in the <i>Parzival</i> and real personages and events of Angevin history. (A reference to
Appendix A, vol. i., 'on the Angevin allusions' will show how close in some cases this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
parallel is.) Now we find that the greater number of these allusions are contained in
the earlier part of the poem, Books <span class="smcap">I.</span>, <span class="smcap">II.</span>, and <span class="smcap">III.</span>, some of the most striking, <i>e.g.</i> the
account of the origin of the Angevin House; the parallel between Gamuret and Fulk <span class="smcap">V.</span>;
and the introduction of Herzeleide, being in the two first books; <i>i.e.</i> that part of the
poem peculiar to Wolfram's version is also the part of the poem richest in indications of
a knowledge of Angevin history.</p>

<p>The fact that Wolfram has an introduction, and a completion, to the Perceval legend
which agree perfectly one with the other, and are not found elsewhere, naturally leads to
the inference that he either had a source other than Chr&ecirc;tien, or that he invented the
books himself; which latter Simrock claims to have been the case. In a case of this
kind, where there is an utter lack of external testimony to help us, we can only judge
from the internal evidence of the work itself, and here we are met at the outset by the
startling phenomenon of a poem, ascribed to the invention of a <i>German</i> poet, abounding
in allusions to a contemporary <i>French</i> line of princes, and evidently designed for the
glorification of that house. It is perfectly true that the princely family in question had risen
to a point of greatness that resulted in their dominating for some years European politics,
but, in the absence of any testimony connecting Wolfram with the House of Anjou, we are
at least entitled to ask how he possibly came to give such a colour to his poem. It is
impossible to avoid being perplexed by such questions as these; how did Wolfram
come to be so familiar with the early history of the Angevin counts? If he wished to
glorify any reigning prince why did he not choose a German, say Hermann of Thuringia,
rather than lead to the suspicion that he wished to compliment a house represented at the
time <i>he</i> wrote by its very worst and weakest descendant, John of Anjou and England?
Why did he lay the adventures of his hero's father in the East, and bring into the story
the curious and enigmatic personality of Feirefis, and, having invented him, give him a
name of undoubted <i>French</i> origin? And even if we pass over the difficulties of the first
two books we are met by other questions just as puzzling, <i>e.g.</i> why did Wolfram, who had
so high an idea of fidelity to his source, and who blamed so strongly the leading poet of
his day for the fault of departing from his supposed model, represent the Grail and the
dwellers in Its castle in the light in which he did? There is no parallel to his Grail-stone
or the 'Templeisen' throughout the whole Grail literature, and we cannot escape from the
alternative of admitting that if Wolfram did not invent all this he found it in a source
unknown to us.</p>

<p>The problem of the Grail has been attempted to be solved by the hypothesis of a
misunderstanding of Chr&ecirc;tien de Troyes, this solution is of course <i>possible</i>, but it must be
admitted that it has the appearance rather of an ingenious evasion than an explanation of
a difficulty, and it holds good for nothing beyond the bare presentment of the Grail as a
<i>stone</i>. The Angevin problem, on the other hand, has so far never been solved at all,
and only its removal hinted at by the suggestion that Walter Mapes was the author of
Wolfram's source, which of course admits that Wolfram <i>had</i> a source other than Chr&ecirc;tien,
and therefore by implication throws doubt on the above suggested explanation of the
Grail which is based on the supposition that Chr&ecirc;tien, and Chr&ecirc;tien alone, was the source
of Wolfram's information. In fact, so long as we refuse to admit the truth of Wolfram's
own explicit statements, so long shall we find the interpretation of the <i>Parzival</i> beset with
innumerable difficulties, the attempted explanation of one part of the problem only rendering
the remaining portion more obscure; but if we will accept it as possible that Wolfram
gave a correct account of the source of his poem, and, divesting our minds of all preconceived
ideas in favour of this or that theory, carefully examine the indications afforded by the
poem itself, we may find that there <i>is</i> a solution which will meet, more or less fully, all
the difficulties which beset the question. Now, as remarked above, when Wolfram wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
his poem the power of the Angevin House was beginning to decline, the date assigned to
the <i>Parzival</i>, with which date all the internal evidences agree, is within the first fifteen
years of the thirteenth century, a period exactly corresponding to the reign of John, and
it may be the first two or three years of that of his successor Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span>, and it was
during the fatuous misgovernment of these princes that the edifice so carefully built up
by the early Angevin counts fell to pieces. Works in glorification of any special house or
kingdom are not, as a rule, written during that house or kingdom's period of decadence,
rather during its time of growth and aggrandisement, and we find as a fact that the events
which led to the accession of an Angevin count to the throne of England 'stirred up,
during the early years of Henry Fitz-Empress' reign, a spirit of patriotic loyalty which led
more than one of his subjects to collect the floating popular traditions of his race, and
weave them into a narrative which passed for a history of the Angevin counts.' (Cf.
<i>England under the Angevin Kings</i>, vol. ii. p. 195.) It is therefore to this period rather
than to a later date, <i>i.e.</i> to Wolfram's source rather than to Wolfram himself, that historical
testimony would bid us assign the Angevin allusions. History also forbids us to
assume that <i>Chr&ecirc;tien</i> could have been the source of Wolfram's information; Chr&ecirc;tien
was of Troyes, in Champagne, therefore an adherent of the House of Blois who were
hereditary foes of the Angevin counts, and not without reason, as the latter were most
undesirable neighbours, and never lost a chance of increasing their dominions at the
expense of their fellow-princes. At one time or another, either by marriage or by conquest,
they annexed all the surrounding estates (though they grasped considerably more than
they could permanently hold), and after the marriage of Henry Fitz-Empress with Eleanor
of Aquitaine, the heiress of Poitou and Guyenne, and of his son Geoffrey with Constance
of Brittany, the whole of the coast-line of France belonged to the Angevin possessions.
It was not surprising that princes of such an acquisitive nature should have many
enemies, and when Henry's sons rebelled against him they were not without friends to
back them up, among them, apparently, was the very Count Philip of Flanders from
whom Chr&ecirc;tien received the book from whence he drew his poem. If then Wolfram in
his first two books was following a French poet, that poet was <i>not</i> Chr&ecirc;tien.</p>

<p>But if the Angevin counts had many foes they had also many adherents, not only in
Europe but in the East, their connection with which dated back to the reign of Fulk
Nerra, or Fulk the Palmer. It was not to a member of an unknown house that Baldwin,
king of Jerusalem, in 1129 sent an invitation to become his son-in-law and successor; nor
did Fulk, when he left Anjou for Jerusalem, go alone&mdash;we are expressly told that he took
a large army with him. Fulk himself died in 1142, but he left sons who succeeded him,
so that the Angevin rule in the East did not end with his death.</p>

<p>Is it then impossible, or even improbable, that this 'Kiot the Proven&ccedil;al' of whom
Wolfram speaks was an adherent of the House of Anjou, who had followed their fortunes
in the East, and who, coming under the spell of the Grail myth in its connection with the
Perceval legend, remodelled the story, probably then still in a rough and transitional form,
in accordance with his own personal experiences and prepossessions? Do not all the
indications afforded by the poem favour this theory? Such a man would have been
thoroughly familiar with the legends that had gathered round the early Angevin princes,
as well as with the historical facts connected with their successors; he would have come
into contact with the Order of the Knights Templars in a land where they were in deed,
and not merely in name, guardians of the Faith; he would be familiar with many a legend
of precious stones, the favourite talisman of the East, and would know the special virtue
ascribed to each; above all, he would have seen before him in a concrete form the contest
between faith and unbelief, darkness and light, Christianity and Heathendom, a black race
and a white, which forms at least one of the leading ideas in the interpretation of the poem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>In fact, if we will allow the existence of such a writer as a travelled Angevin might well
have been, we shall find all the principal problems of the <i>Parzival</i> admit of a rational
explanation. Even the central puzzle, Wolfram's representation of the Grail, is explicable
on such an hypothesis. We know how very vague Chr&ecirc;tien's account of the Grail is; how
much in the dark he leaves us as to Its outward form, Its influence, and Its origin. A
writer <i>before</i> Chr&ecirc;tien is scarcely likely to have been more explicit; what more likely than
that a man long resident in the East, and familiar, as has been said above, with Eastern
jewel talismans and the legends connected with them, when confronted with this mysterious
Grail, of which no definite account was given, yet which apparently exercised a magical
life-sustaining influence, should have jumped to the conclusion of Its, at least partial,
identity with the precious stones of the power of which he had heard so much?</p>

<p>And in connection with this it is worthy of note that Wolfram represents the Grail as
lying on a <i>green</i> Achmardi; in other versions of the Grail romances it is red, or white,
samite that we find mentioned as veiling the relic. Throughout the poem we find <i>green</i>
constantly mentioned, <i>e.g.</i> Gamuret's equipment, the robes of the Grail maidens and of
Gramoflanz, the cross over Gamuret's grave, Trevrezent's shrine or reliquary; all these
allusions seem to point to the writer's familiarity with green as a royal and sacred colour,
a knowledge which could only have been gained in the East. Nor, as mentioned in note
to Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span>, is the description of the Grail the only instance of a mystical influence being
attributed to a precious stone, but throughout the whole poem the constant mention of
gems, and, in special instances, of the virtue they possess, is one of the marked peculiarities
of the poem, and one of the features which differentiate it from Chr&ecirc;tien's version.</p>

<p>That Wolfram had a model for these earlier books, and one that he was following
closely, appears from the description he gives in two places of Kailet's armour; in Book <span class="smcap">I.</span>
we find '<i>do rekande ich abr wol dinen str&ucirc;s, ame schilde ein sarapandra test</i>,' and in Book
<span class="smcap">II.</span> '<i>stit d&icirc;n str&ucirc;s noch sunder nest? Du solt din sarapandra test gein sinem halben gr&icirc;fen</i>
<i>tragen</i>,' where in both instances it is distinctly implied that Kailet had <i>two</i> badges, an
ostrich on his helmet and a snake's head on his shield, which is, to say the least, extremely
unlikely. What seems to be really meant is that Kailet carried the figure of the entire
bird on his helmet, and a representation of its head on his shield; the likeness in the shape
of the latter to a snake's head has often been commented upon, and the ostrich, from its
curious head and neck, has been known as 'the serpent bird.' It seems clear that here at
least Wolfram was following another description, and one which he did not altogether
understand.</p>

<p>As to the conclusion to be drawn from the proper names which occur in such profusion
throughout the poem, this question has been so fully treated by Bartsch (cf. vol. i.
Appendix B) that it would be superfluous to discuss it here; and the correspondence
between the Titurel poems and the Parzival, which argues a common source for both, has
also been adequately discussed, but the addition of the arguments to be derived from the
correspondence existing between Wolfram's Angevin allusions and the facts of Angevin
history, seems to put it beyond doubt that there is a strong body of evidence in support of
Wolfram's own statement that he had a French source other than Chr&ecirc;tien de Troyes;
and, if we admit that he spoke the truth so far, it seems only logical to believe that he was
also speaking the truth when he gave the name of the author of his source as '<i>Kiot the</i>
<i>Proven&ccedil;al</i>.'</p>

RELATION OF WOLFRAM TO CHR&Ecirc;TIEN</h3>

<p>In explanation of the striking agreement which exists between the <i>Parzival</i> of Wolfram
von Eschenbach and that part of <i>Li Conte del Graal</i> which we owe to Chr&ecirc;tien de Troyes,
three solutions may be suggested: (<i>a</i>) That Chr&ecirc;tien was the source of Wolfram; (<i>b</i>) That
Chr&ecirc;tien and Wolfram both drew from a common source, that source, if Wolfram is to be
believed, being Kiot; (<i>c</i>) That Chr&ecirc;tien, who wrote before Wolfram, drew from a source
anterior to Wolfram, which source was also used by Kiot.</p>

<p>For reasons already stated we may dismiss (<i>a</i>) without further argument, and accept
Wolfram's statement as to the existence of a French poem other than Chr&ecirc;tien's; but the
question as to the relationship existing between these two poems, whether the one was
directly the source of the other (as Wolfram seems to have supposed), or whether both
represent a common source, requires to be carefully examined.</p>

<p>The principal difference between the <i>Parzival</i> and the <i>Conte del Graal</i> is in the
Introduction, which is missing entirely in Chr&ecirc;tien, whose account of Perceval's father and
of his death is at variance with all the other versions, and has been supplemented by a
later Introduction, more in harmony with what seems to have been accepted as the original
form of the story, <i>i.e.</i> with the fact of the death of the hero's father <i>before</i> his birth, and
the flight of the <i>widowed</i> mother into the woods. Now, it is of course quite possible, it is
even highly probable, that Chr&ecirc;tien, had he known a version of the story such as Wolfram
gives, would have rejected it on account of its connection with the House of Anjou, but we
cannot base any argument on the absence of this introduction, since Chr&ecirc;tien left his poem
unfinished at a point before the close connection between the first two books and the
ending of the story becomes apparent in Wolfram. Had Chr&ecirc;tien lived to complete his
work we should have then been in a better position to judge whether he knew Kiot's poem
and deliberately set it on one side, or whether he was following another version.</p>

<p>Closely as the two poems agree, it is noticeable that, in more than one instance, Chr&ecirc;tien's
version of an incident is more in harmony with the story as told in other members of the
Grail cycle than is Wolfram's; <i>e.g.</i> Parzival's visit to the court of King Arthur, and
Gawain's adventure in the Ch&acirc;teau Merveil, both of which have been fully treated in the
Notes. It is curious also that in the three versions of the story most closely agreeing, the
<i>Conte del Graal</i>, <i>Parzival</i>, and <i>Peredur</i>, we find the bleeding lance and the sword in
each, while for the 'Grail' talisman we have variously, an enigmatic object of gold set with
precious stones, a stone, and a bleeding head on a dish; this variation seems to point to
the conclusion that the lance and sword, and not the 'Grail,' were the original features of
the story; and accordingly we find in Chr&ecirc;tien that it is the lance, and not the Grail, which
Gawain goes to seek; and the lance is also treated at greater length than is the Grail.</p>

<p>If Wolfram and Chr&ecirc;tien were drawing from the same source it seems strange that it
is in the work of that one of the two who avowedly places a high value on adherence to
the traditional form of the story that we miss just these archaic features.</p>

<p>Again, Wolfram and Chr&ecirc;tien differ very decidedly in their presentment of the Grail
knights and their organisation; if so striking and effective a feature existed in a source
common to both, it is difficult to understand why Chr&ecirc;tien omitted it; he could have had
no such grudge against the Order of Templars as he would reasonably have against the
House of Anjou, and it is equally difficult to believe that if it was <i>not</i> in the source,
Wolfram departed from his avowed principle of fidelity so far as to introduce it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>We also find the same ideas introduced in a different context; thus, when Perceval
leaves his mother to go out into the world, among her counsels the French poet includes,
'<i>Preudom ne forconselle nie celui ki tient sa compagnie</i>'; in Wolfram we have no such
phrase, but when Parzival arrives at Gurnemanz's Castle we find him saying, '<i>M&icirc;n muoter</i>
<i>saget al w&acirc;r, Alt mannes rede st&ecirc;t niht se v&acirc;r</i>,' which in the Parzival she did <i>not</i> say. It
is evident that in the two versions counsel and application have become separated, and in
this case again it seems more probable that the counsel would originally have been given
without the application, as by Chr&ecirc;tien, than <i>vice versa</i> as by Wolfram. On the other
hand, Mr. Nutt points out in his <i>Studies</i> that Perceval's recognition of the knights as
<i>angels</i> is quite at variance with his mother's representation of armed men as <i>devils</i>,
whereas in the <i>Parzival</i> the whole episode is clear and consistent. Here the French poet
has evidently dropped out something, and there are other instances, such as the names of
Gurnemanz's sons, in which the German poem seems to have followed an older tradition.</p>

<p>But on the whole, a careful comparison of the two poems seems to show that Wolfram's
version is further removed from the original form of the story than is Chr&ecirc;tien's, and that
therefore the probability is that the common basis of the two poems was a work known to
the two <i>French</i> poets.</p>

<p>In support of this theory it may be noted as a curious fact that while <i>Chr&ecirc;tien</i>
avowedly bases his poem on a book given to him by the Count of Flanders, <i>Wolfram's</i>
poem really contains more references to Flanders than Chr&ecirc;tien's does. Thus we have
several allusions to Lambekein, Duke of Brabant; Brandelidelein of Punturtois figures
prominently both in the second and in the later books, and his city 'Der Wazzervesten
stat von Punt' (<i>punt</i>=<i>pont</i>=bridge) is suspiciously like Bruges; to say nothing of the
connection of the Lohengrin story with Brabant and Antwerp. It has been pointed out
already by critics that Gerbert, one of Chr&ecirc;tien's continuators, has the same connection of
the Grail winner with the knight of the swan, which seems to indicate that the stories
were not first connected by the <i>German</i> poet (Gerbert also connects with the Swan Knight
with the Deliverer of the Holy Sepulchre, an Oriental and Crusading feature quite in harmony
with what has been suggested with regard to Wolfram's French source).</p>

<p>On the whole, the evidence seems to point to the conclusion that the source of Kiot's
poem was identical with the book delivered to Chr&ecirc;tien by the Count of Flanders; and
the connection between Wolfram and Chr&ecirc;tien is that of a source from which Chr&ecirc;tien drew
at first, Wolfram at second hand, Wolfram's medium having treated the legend with far
more freedom and boldness than was common at that date.</p>


<h3>EXCURSUS C<br />

THE INTERPRETATION AND RELIGIOUS TEACHING OF THE POEM</h3>

<p>The question of the interpretation to be placed upon the <i>Parzival</i> is one of the most
important parts of the problem under discussion. As a rule it has been treated apart
from the question of the <i>source</i>, for critics have been pretty generally unanimous in
declaring that whatever the authority followed as to the story, its employment as a
medium of ethical edification was due to Wolfram and to Wolfram alone. But a careful
examination of the poem seems to indicate that not only were the first germs of a spiritual
interpretation due to another and older writer, but also that a very close and important
connection exists between the interpretation and the source, as alleged by Wolfram
himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, whether we are treating of the source or of the inner signification of the poem,
one of the most important elements in the question is the character of Feirefis. That this
curious personality is as closely connected with the inner, as with the outer, development
of the story many critics have readily admitted, and therefore the question of the <i>origin</i>
of the character becomes one of no little importance. If we can prove that Feirefis is
beyond doubt the invention of Wolfram, then we have a strong argument for believing
that the ethical teaching is also entirely Wolfram's; but if the evidence points the other
way, and is in favour of the theory that Feirefis is an integral part of the original French
source, then there is strong ground for believing that the semi-allegorical treatment of the
subject was also part of Kiot's scheme. Simrock feels this so strongly that he advances
the close connection of Feirefis alike with the <i>grund-idee</i> of the poem and the first two
books to prove that Wolfram <i>must</i> have written those books, since to him alone the moral
teaching can be due.</p>

<p>But is the evidence in favour of the German authorship of these books? Is it not, as
we have shown in the discussion of the Angevin allusions, distinctly <i>against</i> such a conclusion?
And here we must not overlook the fact that the <i>Angevin</i> parentage is insisted
on far more strongly in the case of Feirefis than in that of his brother; it seems indeed
as if the elder brother were regarded specially as the son of his father, from first to last
he is 'Feirefis Angevin,' whereas Parzival is regarded more as the son of the mother
through whom he is connected with the mystic race of the Grail-kings, and bears throughout
the title of 'Waleis,' his mother's, not his father's, land.</p>

<p>A close study of the poem seems to show that it came into Wolfram's hands an
organic whole; in spite of the strong individuality of the German poet which has stamped
itself on every page, in spite of the constant personal allusions, of the characteristic form
into which he has remoulded the story, we feel that he has never lost sight of the original
conception, but, even while working out his own interpretation, has allowed the thread of
his source to run unbroken, if not untangled, to the end. And with that thread Feirefis
is closely inwoven; it is at the critical moment of Parzival's life, when the conventional
faith in God as the All-wise Ruler of the world, which has been sufficient for his boyhood,
fails him, that the hero first learns the existence of his unknown brother, Feirefis Angevin;
from that point onward, whenever the story will admit of an allusion to Feirefis, either
directly, or indirectly through his love Sekundill&eacute;, that allusion is introduced, so that as we
draw towards the end of the poem the mind is not unprepared for the appearance of
Feirefis himself, and the combat which is the last, as it is the most desperate, of Parzival's
trials. The breaking of the sword of Ither of Gaheviess, as well as the exceptional nature
of the conflict itself, is a distinct indication of a special significance attached to the incident,
and one is not surprised to find that the conclusion of Parzival's probation and his
election to the Grail kingdom follow closely upon it. It is impossible to believe that a
personality so strange as that of Feirefis, so closely connected with the hero of the poem,
and brought into special prominence at the turning-points of his career, means nothing at
all; and this when we have the contrast between Doubt and Steadfastness, Darkness and
Light, Black and White directly insisted upon.</p>

<p>The original ethical idea seems to have been simple enough; the sin of lack of faith
in God, which mars an otherwise steadfast character. Feirefis shows, in a concrete form,
the contrast sketched in the opening lines of Book <span class="smcap">I.</span>, and Parzival's final conflict with his
parti-coloured brother signified the final victory over Doubt which rendered him worthy
to win the Grail. The idea of working some such <i>motif</i> into the story may very likely
have arisen from a wish to supply a better and more adequate reason for Parzival's interview
with the Hermit, an episode which, as the <i>Parzival</i> shows, is capable of far finer
treatment than it has received in any other version. (It must not be forgotten that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
Parzival's passionate outbreak and defiance of God is found nowhere else, and that the
duty of trust in God and reliance upon Him in the hour of trouble has been distinctly
part of his early teaching, and that there too the 'black and white' contrast has been
insisted upon.) The idea thus first suggested, the circumstances of a residence in the
East, where such a conflict between light and darkness was actually being carried on,
determined the form into which it should be cast. It is extremely difficult to understand
how <i>Wolfram</i>, if he only possessed the Perceval legend in an incomplete form, conceived
the idea of supplementing it in this special manner; but if <i>Kiot</i> be responsible for the
first introduction of the religious idea, as he was of the Angevin, the problem becomes
perfectly easy, his conception of the struggle in the soul of man was simply a reflection
of the struggle as he saw it in the world.</p>

<p>(It cannot be too strongly insisted upon, that no princes of the day were more strongly
affected by the Crusading spirit, or more closely connected with the East than the Angevin
princes; and that to assume on the part of one of their followers the familiarity with
Crusading ideas which is here ascribed to 'Kiot' is to do little more than state a commonplace
fact of history.)</p>

<p>But that the idea of the poem has, in a measure, undergone a change, and that the
<i>Parzival</i> in its present shape owes much to the genius of the man who, probably attracted
by the ethical turn Kiot had given to the story, took it into his own hands, and, remodelling
it, sent it forth to the world a heritage for all generations, may readily be granted.
No careful reader of the poem can fail to feel that the interpretation is a double one;
that if there are passages which seem to treat of Faith and Doubt only as they affect the
position of the soul towards God, there are others which as clearly treat of the same
questions as affecting man's relation to his fellow-men; in which faith is interpreted in its
widest sense as a loyal fulfilment of <i>all</i> obligations, social as well as religious; and that
all this is summed up and expressed in the inculcation of loyalty to the dictates of the
knightly order in their highest form.</p>

<p>Occasionally these two ideas obviously clash, as when in Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> Trevrezent tells
Parzival that the Grail cannot be won by human effort, and asks, 'Wilt thou force thy
God with thine anger?' and in Book <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> practically takes back his words and admits
that this is what Parzival <i>has</i> done. The true solution of the puzzle seems to be neither
in interpreting the poem exclusively as an allegory of the struggle in the soul of man,
nor exclusively as a confession of faith in the knightly order as a means of salvation, but
rather in admitting that the poem sets forth <i>both</i> these views, and that the lines of
thought cross and recross and overlie one another according as Wolfram reproduced the
ideas of the older poet, or overlaid them with his own.</p>

<p>And if we will believe in the real personality of 'Kiot,' we may find that the religious
teaching of the poem gains a new significance; deeply religious it undoubtedly is, full of
a profound trust in God, a deep conviction of the individual relationship existing between
the soul and its Maker, and a simple acceptance of the elementary doctrines of Christianity,
the Trinity, the Incarnation, and Its extension through the initial Sacrament of Baptism;
but with all this there is a complete absence of ecclesiasticism, and a lack of features
familiar to us in other works of the day.</p>

<p>It is very curious that, constantly as Baptism is insisted upon as essential to salvation,
the equal necessity for the Second Great Sacrament of the Faith is passed over. It is
perfectly true that Wolfram's knights attend Mass, and that Mass is apparently celebrated
with regularity, but here their obligation seems to end; never once do we hear
of one of his knights communicating, even Gamuret, when dying, though he receives
absolution, does not receive the viaticum (the account of Vivians' death in <i>Willehalm</i>
seems to show that elsewhere Wolfram, in common with other writers of the day, <i>did</i>
acknowledge this necessity). Again, though Parzival comes to the Hermit's cell on Good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
Friday, and spends fourteen days in his company, confessing and receiving absolution, we
have no mention of the Easter Communion in the German poem, though we have in the
French. In Book <span class="smcap">X.</span> the wounded knight, whom Gawain succours, asks to be helped to a
<i>spital</i> that his wounds may be attended to; in Chr&ecirc;tien's version he expresses his fear of
dying unabsolved and uncommunicated, and would seek a Hermit who lives near at
hand for that purpose. And this difference between the two versions meets us at every
turn; <i>Chr&ecirc;tien</i> abounds in allusions to the hours of prayer; if he wishes to indicate the
time when any special event happens he mentions that it is just after Prime, or between
Tierce and Noon; Perceval says that if he finds his mother he will make her a veiled
nun, and the mother's counsels in the French poem are emphatic on the subject of
Perceval's religious duties, which Wolfram wholly omits; Chr&ecirc;tien's characters constantly
invoke the saints, which Wolfram's knights never do; when Parzival is in imminent
danger of death it is to his wife, and not to a patron saint, that he looks for aid. Wolfram
is always a religious poet, but, if we compare his other important poem the <i>Willehalm</i>
with the <i>Parzival</i>, we cannot help feeling that the former is decidedly more in harmony
with the thought of his day, and less curiously '<i>modern</i>' in tone than the latter. It is
difficult to resist the conviction that some of the special peculiarities of the <i>Parzival</i> are
due to Wolfram's source quite as much as to Wolfram himself.</p>

<p>It is a commonplace of history that one effect of the contact between heathen and
Christian races brought about by the Crusades was the awakening of a spirit of tolerance
between the brave men on either side. In a day when manly strength and courage were
accounted of such value it was impossible that the existence of such qualities on the side
of the heathen should not, in the opinion of many, go far to counterbalance their lack of
Christianity; and it is certain that among those long resident in the East such tolerance
eventually led to laxity in matters both of faith and practice. It was such laxity that was
the ostensible reason for the fall of the Knights Templars. In the case of a poem, which
otherwise gives indication of familiarity with Oriental custom and tradition, is it unreasonable
to suggest that its peculiarities of religious treatment, its freedom from petty
ecclesiastical details, the breadth and tolerance of its views, and the far more human ideal
of virtue which it presents, may, at least in part, be due to the influence of the Crusading
spirit which we know did, on the whole, make in these directions?</p>

<p>To sum up the entire question, the drift of the internal evidence of the <i>Parzival</i> seems
to indicate that the author of Wolfram's source was a warm partisan of the House of
Anjou, sometime resident in the East, familiar with the History of the House whose
fortunes he followed, and with much curious Oriental legend, and thoroughly imbued with
the broader views of life and religion inspired by the Crusades. That he wrote his poem
<i>after</i> 1172 seems most likely from the connection between England, Anjou, and Ireland
noted in Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span>; on the other hand, the parallel existing between the early history of
Henry Fitz-Empress and that of the hero of the <i>Parzival</i> seems to show that he intended
a compliment to that prince, which would fix the year of Henry's death, 1189, as the
<i>terminus ad quem</i>. The probabilities are that it would be written earlier, before the troubles
of Henry's later years. What we know of the extent of the Angevin rule and influence at
that date renders it quite possible for us to believe that the writer was by birth a Proven&ccedil;al.
That the source of the poem bore a strong affinity to the source of Chr&ecirc;tien's <i>Conte del</i>
<i>Graal</i> is certain, and the many Flemish allusions give colour to the supposition that it may
have been identical with that source.</p>

<p>If we grant the correctness of the Angevin allusions to be found in the earlier parts of
the poem, we must logically grant that these two first Books, and as a consequence the
latter part of the poem which agrees with them, are due to the French source rather than
the German redaction; that it was Kiot who introduced the characters of Gamuret,
Belakan&eacute;, Feirefis, and L&auml;helein; and that to Kiot is due the first germ of the ethical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
interpretation amplified by Wolfram. It was probably in a great measure owing to the
unecclesiastical nature of Kiot's teaching, and the freedom with which he handled the
Grail myth, that his work failed to attain the popularity of Chr&ecirc;tien's. When the Grail
legend was once definitely stamped with the traditional-Christian character which it
finally assumed and retained, the semi-pagan character of Kiot's treatment would cause
his version to be regarded with disfavour by the monkish compilers of his day. It is
probably owing to the accident of Maude's first husband having been Emperor of Germany
that this particular presentment of the story found its way into that country; it may well
be that it is, indirectly, to that very Angevin element that has for so long perplexed critics
that we owe its preservation! As regards the Grail problem itself, it therefore seems most
probable that in Wolfram's <i>Parzival</i> we have no really independent version of the Grail
myth, such as may be taken into consideration by scholars when constructing a scientific
theory of its development; but simply an interesting specimen of one form which, in the
period of its translation from a pagan to a Christian symbol, it temporarily assumed, that
form being entirely coloured and determined by the personality of the writer.</p>


<h3>EXCURSUS D<br />

THE WORKS OF WOLFRAM VON ESCHENBACH</h3>

<p>Besides the <i>Parzival</i>, Wolfram's longest and, from every point of view, most important
work, we possess seven songs belonging to the class known as Tage-or W&auml;chter-Lieder;
thus called because the secret lovers, who have indulged their passion during the hours of
night, are warned by the call of the watchman from the ramparts of the approach of day
and of the hour of parting. Though Wolfram made in these songs a concession to the
lax morality of his day, the concluding lines of one of them clearly show how far superior
to such unlawful passion he held the love of wedded wife and husband, such love as he
has immortalised in Kondwiramur and Parzival. Beside these songs, we have the poems
dealing with the loves of Sigun&eacute; and Schionatulander, and classed together under the
name of <i>Titurel</i>. Whether these are complete in themselves, and intended to serve as
an explanatory addition to the <i>Parzival</i>, or whether they are fragments of an unfinished
poem, does not very clearly appear; in any case they indicate a source identical with that
of the <i>Parzival</i>.</p>

<p><i>Willehalm</i>, Wolfram's other great epic poem, in nine books, deals with the history of
William of Orange, a contemporary of Charlemagne, whose story belongs to this cycle of
French Romance. The poem is clearly derived from the old French <i>Chanson de Geste,</i>
<i>Aliscans</i>, and is originally founded on the prolonged struggle between the Saracen and
Christian power in the South of France, a struggle which for poetical purposes has been
condensed into two battles of Aliscans, or Alischanz, in the first of which the Christians
are defeated, while in the second they are victorious. Whether this poem, too, is or is
not unfinished, is a matter of debate among critics; judging from Wolfram's method
in the <i>Parzival</i>, the fact that he leaves the fate of his hero 'Rennewart' in uncertainty,
and does not even reveal the secret of his parentage and close connection with William's
wife, seems to indicate that he did not finish the poem. <i>Willehalm</i> abounds in references
to the <i>Parzival</i>, and in similar turns of thought and expression, and has some
passages of great beauty. The <i>Titurel</i> is also written in a more elaborate metre than
the other poems, and some doubt has been expressed as to which of these two represents
Wolfram's latest work. The style of both is more finished than that of the <i>Parzival</i>,
but they are both inferior alike in depth of thought and human interest to this, the
greatest work of Germany's greatest medi&aelig;val poet.</p>

<p>Introduction, lines 1-19. In Book <span class="smcap">X.</span> the poet returns to Gawain, taking up the story
at the point at which he dropped it in Book <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> The corresponding book in Chr&ecirc;tien
commences very abruptly, making no further mention of the challenge between Gawain
and Kingrimursel (Guigambresil) or of Gawain's search for the Grail (or Lance). It is
doubtful whether the passage beginning with line 15 really refers to traditional adventures
ascribed to Gawain, and omitted here, or whether it is merely introduced in order to
soften down the abrupt transition from the story of Parzival to that of Gawain. From the
fact that, both here and in Chr&ecirc;tien, this incident of Gawain's meeting with the wounded
knight follows immediately after Parzival's interview with the hermit, it seems certain that
a similar sequence existed in the source common to both; on the other hand, in line 804,
Wolfram seems to be referring to a definite version of the Gawain episode, which certainly
differed from Chr&ecirc;tien's. Here, as elsewhere, in the absence of any <i>external</i> evidence, it
is not possible to speak with certainty.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_4">4</a>, line 29&mdash;'<i>Kamilla</i>.' A reference to the <i>&AElig;neid</i> of Heinrich von Veldeck, where
Kamilla, the daughter of Turnus, is represented as defending Laurentium against the
Trojans, and being slain on the field of battle. Cf. Book <span class="smcap">XII.</span> p. 52.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_4">4</a>, lines 39, 40&mdash;'<i>On her knee she bore a knight</i>.' This incident occurs under exactly
the same circumstances in Chr&ecirc;tien, there, too, Gawain comes to the rescue of the knight
by arousing him from his stupor, though the surgery, of which Wolfram gives so curious
an account, finds no parallel in the French poem. The reader will not fail to notice the
likeness between this incident and Parzival's meeting with Sigun&eacute;, in Book <span class="smcap">III.</span> As will be
pointed out later Wolfram evidently intended a parallel, or a contrast, between his two
heroes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_5">5</a>, line 63&mdash;'<i>Lischois Giwellius</i>.' This name, again, seems to be a misunderstanding
of a French original, in Chr&ecirc;tien the knight is not named, the passage; '<i>li</i>
<i>Orguelleus de la roce &agrave; l'estroite voie, qui garde les pors de Galvoie</i>' in which some critics
have found the origin of the name, seems rather to refer to the knight overthrown by
Gawain in Book <span class="smcap">XII.</span> and named Florand by Wolfram. <i>Here</i> there is a distinct identity
between the knight now referred to and him who fights with Gawain later (p. <a href="#Page_20">20</a>); in
Chr&ecirc;tien the knight who opposes Gawain is the nephew of the wounded man, and therefore
can scarcely be the guardian of the '<i>bogue de Galvoie</i>' who overthrows him. Later on
Wolfram uses a French expression to indicate where the knight in question was wounded,
<i>Av estroite m&acirc;voi&eacute;</i>, which distinctly indicates a <i>ford</i> rather than a <i>ravine</i> as in Chr&ecirc;tien
(translated Perilous Ford, p. <a href="#Page_13">13</a>), and the whole incident, carefully examined, decidedly
points to a French source, <i>other</i> than Chr&ecirc;tien.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_5">5</a>, line 74&mdash;'<i>Spake o'er it spells of healing</i>.' As all students of folk-lore are well
aware, a belief in the virtue of certain formula of words for the healing of bodily ailments
was at one time practically universal, and indeed, in certain districts, a belief in them exists
to this day. In vol. ii. of <i>Grundriss der Germanischen Philologie</i> (part <span class="smcap">I.</span>), a number of
such spells, collected from old German <span class="smcap">MSS.</span> are given; among them will be found one for
checking the flow of blood, and another for the closing of a wound.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_5">5</a>, line 77&mdash;'<i>Logrois</i>,' French Logres. In Malory we have Logris, which has
been identified with Loegria, or Saxon Britain.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_6">6</a>, line 90&mdash;'<i>Orgelus&eacute;</i>.' This name, like Orilus, is a misunderstanding of a French
original. Chr&ecirc;tien calls the lady 'L'Orguelleuse de Logres,' and it evidently stood so in
Wolfram's source. This incident of a knight proffering his services to, and riding with, a
lady who repays him with mockery, and finds food for mirth in his misfortunes, seems to
have been a favourite theme with medi&aelig;val writers. Malory gives two such adventures,
one of which, that of La Cote Male Taile and the damsel Maledisant, is, curiously enough,
connected with the Castle <i>Orgulous</i>. The adventure as recounted by Chr&ecirc;tien closely
parallels the German version, but the latter is told at greater length, and the lady appears
to decidedly more advantage; her mockery, though biting, is more in the vein of a courtly
lady, and, what we should not expect to find, there is far more lightness of touch and
'malice,' in the French sense of the word, about the German than about the French poet.
The little touch on p. <a href="#Page_9">9</a>, lines 192, 193 (If a woman ye thus behold), is lacking in Chr&ecirc;tien,
and is decidedly in keeping with the dry humour of Wolfram, who, in spite of his respect
for women, delights in a sly hit at feminine weaknesses. The very curious adjuration of
the old knight, on the same page, 'May He who made salt the sea,' seems, according to
Bartsch, to be frequent in old French literature, '<i>Qui fit la mer sal&eacute;e</i>,' but does not occur
at all in Chr&ecirc;tien, who here simply has 'Dieu le Souverain P&ecirc;re.'</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_10">10</a>, line 235&mdash;'<i>Malcr&eacute;ature</i>.' This squire appears in Chr&ecirc;tien, but is not connected
in any way with Kondrie, though it may be noted that the description given of him in the
French poem agrees far more closely with Wolfram's description of the Grail Messenger
than the latter does with Chr&ecirc;tien's <i>Maiden</i>. Bartsch says that the curious account of
this strange people 'rests on Talmudic tradition, and is repeated in many medi&aelig;val writings,
Latin, German, and Romance.' In Wolfram's poem of <i>Willehalm</i> he introduces a
strange 'horned' people who come from the banks of the Ganges, and who speak with
no human tongue. Chr&ecirc;tien has nothing corresponding to this wild story, nor is his
squire named.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_12">12</a>, line 274&mdash;'<i>Anfortas</i>.' This is the first indication that the lady in whose
service Anfortas received his incurable wound was Orgelus&eacute;. Cf. Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 275. The
story is more fully told in Book <span class="smcap">XII.</span> p. 65.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_12">12</a>, line 281&mdash;'<i>I wot well e'en Dame Jeschut&eacute;, etc</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">V.</span> p. 145.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_13">13</a>, line 311&mdash;'<i>A spital shall stand near by</i>.' Chr&ecirc;tien's knight wishes to be
taken to a <i>Hermit</i> that he may confess and receive the sacrament. The incident is a good
illustration of the different tone of the two poems: Chr&ecirc;tien's is deeply imbued with the
ecclesiasticism of his day, and abounds in references to hours of prayer, religious services,
and invocation of saints, all of which are lacking in Wolfram's version, which, nevertheless,
is far more thoroughly pervaded with the religious <i>spirit</i>.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_14">14</a>, line 349&mdash;'<i>Is it thou, O Urian?</i>' In Chr&ecirc;tien the name of the knight is
Griogoras. Urian appears to be the same name as Friam, which we meet with later
on, Book <span class="smcap">XIII.</span> p. 92. The main outline of his story is the same in the French as in the
German poet, but there are some significant points of divergence. In Chr&ecirc;tien we have
no mention of the trial before the king, nor of the death-sentence; Gawain appears to
have punished the knight on his own account, and his anger is therefore more intelligible,
especially as Chr&ecirc;tien gives an additional touch of ignominy to his punishment, '<i>les</i> Il
<i>mains lii&egrave;s au dos</i>'; and we hear nothing of the special right of message-bearer, by outraging
which Urian broke 'the peace of the land.' The <i>incident</i> itself is a common one
with medi&aelig;val writers, but it is generally treated lightly, and the punishment, as a rule,
was a money fine. It seems as if the more serious manner in which the episode is treated
by Wolfram were to be accounted for by the maiden's official position. Throughout the
poem there are frequent allusions to the manners, customs, and modes of government of
his day, and, where Chr&ecirc;tien seems to give us simply a world of romance, Wolfram seems
to aim at investing his story with reality by surrounding it with the atmosphere of the
time in which he lived.</p>

<p>The indignation expressed by Orgelus&eacute; (line 417) is peculiar to Wolfram's version, and
seems somewhat out of keeping with the general laxity of her conduct.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_18">18</a>, line 465&mdash;'<i>Amor and Cupid</i>.' Amor and Cupid were regarded by the poets
of the Middle Ages as two separate gods, both being the children of Venus.</p>

<p>The fine passage, lines 480-496, is an eloquent exposition of Wolfram's belief in the
superiority of lawful love over the mere earthly passion, too often unlawful, sanctioned, if
not encouraged, by the prevailing licence accorded to <i>Minne-Dienst</i>. Throughout this
poem Wolfram is a steadfast upholder of the binding nature of the marriage vow;
Parzival's fidelity to his wife is held to be a virtue sufficient to cancel any other sin of which
he may be guilty; cf. Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 270, where Trevrezent's words are a sufficient commentary
on the rarity of such fidelity in those days. At the same time Wolfram accepts
the prevailing ideal, and it must be noted that it was he, and not a poet of laxer principles,
such as Gottfried von Strasbourg, who first brought into vogue the <i>W&auml;chter-lieder</i>, the
very essence of which is that the love to which they give eloquent voice is an unlawful love,
and must be indulged in secrecy and under the cover of night.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_19">19</a>, line 506 and <i>seq.</i>&mdash;'<i>A Castle so fair and stately</i>.' This is Ch&acirc;teau Merveil,
mentioned by Kondrie, Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span> p. 181.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_22">22</a>, line 598&mdash;'<i>Gringuljet</i>.' Chr&ecirc;tien explains how Lischois Giwellius comes to
be in possession of Gawain's horse; he is, according to the French poet, the nephew of the
wounded knight Griogoras, who has sent him to attack Gawain, and has given him the
horse stolen from that hero for the purpose. For the meaning of the name, cf. vol i.
Appendix B. The previous history of the steed has been alluded to twice, Books <span class="smcap">VII.</span>
p. 196 and <span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 272. In the latter passage Trevrezent recognises Parzival's horse, also
a Grail steed, by the dove on its saddle, here the badge is branded on the horse itself.
The fight between Lischois and Gawain is told at much greater length here.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_24">24</a>, line 661&mdash;'<i>This right was his o'er the meadow</i>.' The tribute due to the Ferryman
is also related in Chr&ecirc;tien, where Gawain evades it in the same manner.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_26">26</a>, line 729&mdash;'<i>Klingsor</i>.' The magician, lord of the Ch&acirc;teau Merveil, has not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
been named before; he is identical with the 'clerk who all magic knew,' cf. Book <span class="smcap">II.</span> p. 39.
Chr&ecirc;tien has not this character at all; the castle, according to him, was built by '<span class="smcap">I.</span> <i>sages</i>
<i>clers d'astrenomie</i>,' who came there with King Arthur's mother, but there is no indication
that the lady eloped with him, nor does he play any part in the story. The origin of the
name seems to be uncertain; in the poem of the <i>Wartburg-krieg</i>, already alluded to (note
to Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span>), Klingsor appears as a magician from Hungary, and Simrock thinks that
here his name is derived from Klings&aelig;re, a singer or minstrel, and that Wolfram was
weaving into his poem an old legend illustrative of the power of song. San Marte derives
the name from an old French word <i>clincher</i>, and thinks it indicative of the sensual
character ascribed to the magician, and that the character is of French origin. Merlin is,
of course, the Arthurian magician, and appears as such in Chr&ecirc;tien's continuators, but
there is no sign of him in the <i>Parzival</i>, nor can the incidents related of Klingsor be
paralleled in the history of Merlin.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_27">27</a>, line 774&mdash;'<i>Ben&eacute;</i>.' The part assigned to this character in Wolfram is important,
the maiden does not appear in Chr&ecirc;tien's version, <i>here</i> she plays an active part
as confidant of Itonj&eacute;, Gawain's sister, in her love affair with King Gramoflanz and acts as
messenger between the lovers. Some critics have derived her name from a misunderstanding
of Chr&ecirc;tien's phrase, <i>que bencois soit votre ostu</i>, spoken by Gawain to the boatman,
and, of course, such a phrase <i>may</i> have stood in Wolfram's French source, but, as he
certainly did not borrow the character from Chr&ecirc;tien, it seems scarcely likely that he
borrowed the name.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_28">28</a>, lines 785-790&mdash;'<i>Purslain and lettuce</i>.' The dish was apparently a kind of
salad. Wolfram makes an ingenious use of the mention of vinegar to impress upon his
readers the folly of speaking untruly, and incidentally shows that the use of rouge was not
unknown in his day.</p>

<p>[Gawain's adventures with the Proud Lady (Orgelus&eacute;) and at the Castle of Wonders
form, perhaps, the most confused and perplexing portion of the poem, while they also
bear obvious marks of age and of freedom from the Christian symbolism which has so profoundly
affected the 'Grail' legend as a whole. 'The Proud Lady' seems to be a composite
creation; the characteristics of a courtly lady of the day having been grafted on
to an originally supernatural conception. According to this latter, she was a water-fairy
(note that Gawain meets her by the side of a spring, Book <span class="smcap">X.</span> p. 6), mistress of a magic
garden, in which are held captive the mortals whom she incites to a perilous venture, <i>i.e.</i>
the crossing of the stream which separates this from the other world, and the bringing
thence a branch plucked from a tree growing there. This adventure is of course only to
be achieved by the best knight in the world, the hero, namely, of the episode, and to urge
him to it she uses every species of raillery. When the hero has performed the task she
gladly yields herself his. This incident, in itself a straightforward and intelligible one
to which many parallels might easily be adduced from romantic and heroic literature, is,
however, crossed and blended with another adventure of the same hero, the achieving the
feats of the Wonder Castle, and thereby overcoming its magician builder.</p>

<p>The two episodes, originally told each for itself, coalesced owing to the personages in
each being the same; for the Proud Lady is, I believe, far more intimately connected
with the Wonder Castle than appears from Wolfram's poem; I suspect her, indeed, of
being the magician's daughter. That the wedding of Gawain with Orgelus&eacute; should take
place in the Ch&acirc;teau Merveil is at present almost the only trace remaining of the original
connection, but that is decisive. For, as will be pointed out in Note to Book <span class="smcap">XI.</span>, the
episode of the Wonder Castle must originally have ended in the hero's remaining there;
he has won to the other world whence he cannot return, but over which he rules, in com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>pany
with its fair mistress. As it is, the reader cannot but feel that the winning of the
Branch is an anti-climax after the achievement of the Castle of Wonders.</p>

<p>The true significance of the Proud Lady's garden has also been obscured in our poem;
it may possibly at one time have been confused with the Wonder Castle, and might then
be compared with the Garden of Joy which Merlin created for Ninian; there is indeed a
strong temptation to compare Merlin and Ninian with Klingsor and Orgelus&eacute;, wide as the
difference is between the two stories. But it is more probable that the Magic Garden
belongs wholly to the Winning of the Branch feat, and that, like the remainder of this
episode, it has suffered from contamination with the Wonder Castle story. (In connection
with this it may be noted that in Chr&ecirc;tien, Gawain, after crossing the Perilous Ford,
is not to pluck the branch of any one special tree, but to gather the flowers which he sees,
'<i>A ces arbres et &aacute; ces pr&eacute;s.</i>' The idea of a <i>garden</i> seems to have been better preserved in
the French than in the German poem.)</p>

<p>Another portion of the original story, the flyting of hero and heroine, has been completely
remodelled by the twelfth century poets, in order to afford an exemplification of
the current ideal of courtly love and lady-service; hence the complex character of the
heroine, and the confused nature of the episode as related by Wolfram. It would be
useless to seek in pre-twelfth century literature for an <i>exact</i> parallel to a situation so
manifestly coloured to suit the prevailing social ideas of the time; but the episode must
have some root in preceding literature, the special form of the social relation of man to
woman which is the most marked feature of twelfth century literary art must stand in
<i>some</i> relation to the past; and it is in the Irish heroic literature of the seventh to the
eleventh centuries that we must seek for the origin of this feature.</p>

<p>In this literature we find a remarkable parallel to the whole Gawain-Orgelus&eacute; episode.
'The Wooing of Emer' by Cuchulainn is one of the most famous stories about the
greatest Irish hero. Emer was the daughter of Forgall the Wily, the chief maiden of
Ireland in all virtues and qualities, and therefore the only one whom Cuchulainn deemed
worthy of him. But she is by no means minded to take him at his own estimation; when
he recounts his achievements, 'these are goodly fights of a tender boy,' says she, nor will
she consent to see him until he perform certain definite feats. Moreover, her father is by
no means anxious that she should marry, and to get rid of the wooer has him sent off with
two companions on a perilous expedition to Skye. The first danger he encountered (I
quote textually from the oldest version of the story, ascribed by the editor, Professor
Kuno Meyer, to the eighth century) is 'some dreadful beast like a lion, which fought with
him, but did him no harm, and the foul play of the youths who laughed at him' (<i>Revue</i>
<i>Celtique</i>, vol. <span class="smcap">X.</span> 44). Afterwards he has to make his way across the 'plain of ill-luck' on
which men freeze, and by a narrow path over a glen, and a 'terrible stony height.'
Cuchulainn of course comes safely through all these and other ventures, and carries off
Emer, whom he weds. Here, then, we have the contemptuous attitude of the wooed
maiden, her indication of feats to be performed before she can be won; and before the
final marriage a series of incidents bearing no small resemblance to those which befall
Gawain at the Wonder Castle.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Alfred Nutt.</span>]</p>

<p>(There is a Castle of Wonders in 'Peredur,' but the adventures connected with it are
quite different.)</p>

<p>The entire episode of the Magic Castle and Gawain's adventures therein is stamped
with a weird, fantastic character, unlike the rest of the poem, and gives the effect of a
M&auml;hrchen introduced into the midst of a knightly epic. More than one critic has pointed
out the similarity between the tasks to be achieved by Gawain, before he becomes lord of
the castle, and those which, in old folk-tales, fall to the lot of those who dare a venture to
the shadowy under-world. Some of the features in the story, which will be noted as they
occur, seem to distinctly indicate that such was the original nature of this episode, related
with so much spirit by the German poet.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_34">34</a>, line 107&mdash;'<i>He who at Nantes slew Prince Ither</i>.' Cf. Books <span class="smcap">VII.</span> p. 218 and <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>
p. 242, and notes on these passages, where Wolfram's introduction of the chief hero of the
poem, unmentioned in Chr&ecirc;tien's version, is commented upon. Some critics have drawn a
contrast between the Ch&acirc;teau Merveil, with its magic lord, and the Grail Castle, with its
wounded king, which are won respectively by the two heroes of the poem, and have seen
in the castle of Klingsor the embodiment of the fleshly principle, opposed to the spiritual
realm of the Grail. But Wolfram seems to have intended a <i>parallel</i> rather than a <i>contrast</i>.
Klingsor, on the whole, is by no means a malicious character, and of the deadly antagonism
between him and the Grail knights, which is the very essence of Wagner's <i>Parzival</i>, there
is here no trace. If there is a contrast between spirit and sense in Wolfram's poem, it is
rather to be found between the court and knighthood of Monsalv&auml;sch and that of King
Arthur, and the latter monarch certainly embodies the world-principle far more than Klingsor
does. Parzival's failure to ask the question here is quite in keeping with his general character
and devotion to a single aim, but the introduction of the incident was doubtless intended
to heighten the parallel between Monsalv&auml;sch and Ch&acirc;teau Merveil.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_35">35</a>, line 125&mdash;'<i>Now arm thee for deadly warfare!</i>' In Chr&ecirc;tien's account the
Boatman plays the same kindly part of adviser, and, further, accompanies Gawain to the
palace and to the hall of the Lit-Merveil, but, as before noted, the part played by the
daughter is omitted.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_36">36</a>, line 162&mdash;'<i>A merchant with merchandise costly</i>.' In Chr&ecirc;tien this character
is an 'Eski&eacute;kier,' rather a money-changer than a merchant. The story of the oath, and
how it came to be in the courtyard of the castle, is rally related in Book <span class="smcap">XII.</span> p. 65.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_36">36</a>, line 169&mdash;'<i>The Baruch of Bagdad</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">I.</span> p. 9, and note on 'Rankulat.'
The allusion to the Emperor of Greece shows that this was written after the taking of
Constantinople by the Crusaders in 1204.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_37">37</a>, line 185&mdash;'<i>Plippalin&ograve;t</i>.' The Boatman is unnamed in Chr&ecirc;tien. The critics
give no interpretation of the name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_37">37</a>, line 201&mdash;'<i>The Lechfeld</i>.' The Lechfeld is a wide plain near Augsburg
between the rivers Werch and Lech, where the Hungarians were defeated in 955 by the
Emperor Otho. Naturally, the courtyard of a castle could not be so large, and it seems
probable that Wolfram was commenting humorously on the exaggerated description
given in his source. Chr&ecirc;tien gives much the same account of the castle and its gorgeous
decorations.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_38">38</a>, line 220&mdash;'<i>The Lit-Merveil</i>.' Chr&ecirc;tien gives a more detailed description of
the magic couch: it is of gold, with cords of silver, and bells hanging from the interlaced
cords. It is apparently the peal of these bells, as the knight seats himself upon the couch,
that gives warning of the intruder, and is the signal for the enchantments to begin. In
Chr&ecirc;tien's account the attack by the five hundred unseen foes (Gawain has already been
informed by the Boatman that five hundred knights guard the castle) follows immediately
on the hero taking his seat on the couch, and the onslaught of the lion immediately
on the cross-bows, so that the ordeal, as represented by Wolfram, is considerably more
severe and prolonged than in the French version.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_40">40</a>, line 299&mdash;'<i>A mighty lion</i>.' The encounter with the lion is the same in
Chr&ecirc;tien; there, too, the lion's paw is smitten off by Gawain, and remains hanging to the
shield. The remark in line 312 is quite in keeping with Wolfram's dry, quaint humour;
such 'asides' are lacking throughout in the French poem.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_41">41</a>, line 331&mdash;'<i>Mount Ribbel&eacute;</i>.' An allusion to Eilhart's <i>Tristan</i>, where Gymele,
Isolde's maid, gives to Kahenis, who should keep watch with her, a magic pillow on which
he slumbers throughout the night, and is mocked in consequence.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_42">42</a>, line 340&mdash;'<i>Arniv&eacute;</i>.' This is Arthur's mother, whose elopement with Klingsor
has been mentioned, cf. Book <span class="smcap">II.</span> p. 39. (Whether Arniv&eacute; went with Klingsor of her own free
will, or whether she was constrained by magic art, does not clearly appear; from Book <span class="smcap">II.</span>
we should conclude the former, but the passage in Book <span class="smcap">XIII.</span> pp. 89 and 90, reads as if she
were not a free agent.) She has been named as one of the dwellers in Ch&acirc;teau Merveil,
(Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span> p. 189); how it was that Arthur, who had apparently spent some years in the
search for his mother (cf. Book <span class="smcap">II.</span> p. 39), failed to recognise her name when mentioned before
him, is not explained. But the whole episode, as noted above, is so wild and fantastic, and
so full of difficulties, that it seems most probable that it was not originally connected with
the Arthurian legend, and has been only imperfectly fitted into the framework. In Chr&ecirc;tien,
too, the queen is Arthur's mother, but she is much less prominent in the story, indeed
from this point onwards the two versions diverge considerably. In Chr&ecirc;tien, Gawain is
by no means seriously wounded; the Boatman, who seems to have awaited the issue of
the adventure outside the castle, returns promptly and tells him that the enchantments are
at an end, and Gawain is greeted by a train of pages, gaily dressed and playing flutes; and
maidens, one of whom bears royal robes. Chr&ecirc;tien then introduces a very curious and
archaic feature, to which Wolfram has no parallel; Gawain expresses his desire to leave
the castle and hunt in the surrounding forest, but the Boatman tells him this is impossible;
it is judged and decreed that whoever achieves the venture of the Ch&acirc;teau Merveil shall
never leave the castle, '<i>Que jamais de cette maison n'istroit u fust tors u raison. Jamais</i>
<i>n'istr&eacute;s nul jor</i>,' at which Gawain is extremely angry. Nevertheless, he does leave the
castle and no harm comes of it. The only explanation of this curious feature seems to be
that this episode, as noted above, found its origin in the story of some hero's visit to the
under-world, when his return to the world of the living depends on his fulfilment of certain
conditions, <i>e.g.</i>, that he should eat nothing during his stay in the land of shadows; Gawain
certainly partakes of a meal in the Magic Castle, which meal in Wolfram precedes, though
in Chr&ecirc;tien it follows, his attempt to leave Ch&acirc;teau Merveil. Heinzel understands
Chr&ecirc;tien's account of the arrival of the two elder queens in Terre de Merveil as meaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
that they really were dead, and supernaturally revived; (Chr&ecirc;tien certainly does say of the
elder queen, '<i>Qui fus mis en ti&egrave;re</i>,' but as he goes on to state that she brought all her
riches with her into the country where she came, accompanied by her daughter, it is rather
difficult to understand what he really does mean.) Mr. Nutt remarks, 'I think there can
be no doubt that Klingsor's castle is a form of the other world, and that its inhabitants
cease to live if they return to this world. There is a distinct parallelism in the original
form of the legend between Parzival's winning the Grail Castle and Gawain's winning the
Magic Castle. On this theory neither, of course, should come back to Arthur's court; the
necessity of bringing them both into contact with Arthur again has obscured the significance
of the story.'</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_43">43</a>, line 370&mdash;'<i>Ilinot the Breton</i>.' Arthur's son, alluded to in Book <span class="smcap">VII.</span> p. 217,
and note (which also explains the allusion to 'the mystic beasts' which seem to have been
the badge of the royal Breton house). Ilinot's history is told at some length in Book <span class="smcap">XII.</span>
p. 50.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_44">44</a>, line 422&mdash;'<i>Dictam, the herb of healing</i>.' San Marte says that this herb is
mentioned by Cicero, Virgil, and Pliny, as possessing the power of drawing arrow-shafts
from a wound. Wolfram, also, attributed this virtue to it, as he distinctly states in
<i>Willehalm</i>, where he gives an account of his hero's wounds being dressed by his wife.</p>

<p>The allusion to Kondrie should be noted; it is another instance of the skill with which
Wolfram connects all the threads of his story, and never loses sight of his main point.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_49">49</a>, lines 5-18&mdash;'<i>Launcelot on the sword-bridge battled</i>.' This passage to line 18
contains numerous allusions to the knightly tales of the day, some of which have been
previously referred to. Launcelot's fight with Meljakanz and subsequent freeing of
Queen Guinevere is mentioned in Book <span class="smcap">VII.</span> (pp. 205, 219 and Note).</p>

<p>The story of Garel and the lion is not known to us; he was the hero of a later poem
by Pleier, but this adventure does not appear in it. Garel and Gaherjet we find again in
Book <span class="smcap">XIII.</span> p. 96, according to Chr&ecirc;tien they were Gawain's brothers, but Wolfram seems
to regard them merely as kinsmen. (The fact that Wolfram knows only <i>one</i> brother,
Beau-corps, whereas Chr&ecirc;tien mentions two, if not three, seems to indicate that he was
here following a different source.) '<i>The Perilous Ford</i>' we shall meet with presently;
and Erec and the venture of Schoie-de-la-kurt have been alluded to in Book <span class="smcap">III.</span> pp. 76
and 100, and Note; and Book <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> p. 245.</p>

<p>The allusion to Iwein is taken from Hartmann's poem of that name, which relates that
in the wood Briziljan (Broceliande) there was a spring beside which hung a golden basin;
if any one drew water from the spring in this basin, and poured it upon a stone near by, a
violent storm immediately arose which devastated the wood, and slew the game therein.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
As soon as the tempest was over the lord of the spring appeared in full armour and
demanded satisfaction for the mischief done. Iwein withstands this venture, slays the
knight, and eventually, by Lunete's counsel, marries his widow. Cf. Book <span class="smcap">V.</span> p. 143, and
Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 252.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_50">50</a>, lines 39-64&mdash;'<i>They yielded thee loyal service</i>,' <i>etc.</i> Mazadan, cf. Book <span class="smcap">I.</span> p. 31
and Book <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> 230 and Note. Ither of Gaheviess needs no further notice. Ilinot has
already been alluded to, Book <span class="smcap">VII.</span> p. 217 and Book <span class="smcap">XI.</span> p. 43. This is the first full account
given of this prince, hitherto his fate has only been alluded to; we know nothing of this
character, but it is quite evident from such passages as these, and Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span> p. 171, that
Wolfram was familiar with Arthurian romances other than those which have come down
to us. Ilinot, being Arthur's son, was of course first cousin to Gawain; the relationship
with Parzival is much more distant, and, though Arthur speaks of Parzival as his 'nephew,'
the term must be taken in a much wider sense than we should now understand it; from
Wolfram's own account Parzival cannot have been more than very distantly connected
with the House of Pendragon.</p>

<p>Galoes and Gamuret, cf. Book <span class="smcap">II.</span> pp. 46, 52, and 59.</p>

<p>The loves of Itonj&eacute; and Gramoflanz occupy a considerable part of the next two books.
Surdamur was Gawain's sister, and married the Emperor of Greece, Alexander; their
son was Clig&eacute;s, the hero of Chr&ecirc;tien's poem of that name, in the early part of which the
tale of their love is fully told. (Cf. Note to Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span> '<i>Sir Klias</i>.') None of these allusions
are to be found in Chr&ecirc;tien, whose books, as a rule, lack introductory passages;
but, as noted in Book <span class="smcap">XI.</span>, from the conclusion of the Lit-Merveil incident onwards the
two poems diverge widely in detail, though the outline of the story is identical.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_52">52</a>, line 89&mdash;'<i>Arras</i>.' A town in Picardy, famous in the Middle Ages for its stuffs.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_52">52</a>, line 97&mdash;'<i>A shining pillar</i>.' This magic pillar, of which a full account is
given further on (lines 109 and 143), is peculiar to Wolfram's version. In Chr&ecirc;tien we
have simply a watch-tower, from the windows of which Gawain can see the country.
Later on we find the deadly fight between Parzival and Feirefis mirrored on this pillar, and
the news of the encounter conveyed to Arthur's court before the arrival of the heroes.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_52">52</a>, line 98&mdash;'<i>The coffin of Kamilla</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">X.</span> p. 4 and Note. Heinrich
von Veldeck gives a minute account of this coffin.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_52">52</a>, line 101&mdash;'<i>Master Geometras</i>.' It is curious to find geometry thus personified.
The same mistake has apparently been made by Heinrich von Veldeck, who makes
Geometras the designer of Kamilla's coffin.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_53">53</a>, line 119&mdash;'<i>Came the ag&egrave;d queen Arniv&eacute;</i>.' According to Chr&ecirc;tien there are
two queens, mother and daughter, and a maiden, daughter to the younger queen, who is
named Clarissant. Gawain's mother he does not name at all, the old queen has her
original name of Yguerne. In Chr&ecirc;tien the elder lady asks Gawain at once if he is one of
King Arthur's knights, and questions him closely as to King Arthur, King Lot, and the
sons of the latter; but apparently Gawain's curiosity is in no way aroused, and he makes
no attempt to learn who the ladies are, though he makes a compact with the old queen
that she shall not ask <i>his</i> name for seven days. The account, so humorously given by
Wolfram of Arniv&eacute;'s curiosity and unavailing attempts to discover Gawain's identity, is
lacking in the French poet. It is difficult to understand how it is that <i>Gawain</i> has no
suspicion of the real facts of the case till enlightened by Gramoflanz, but, as remarked
above, the whole episode is mysterious and perplexing.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_54">54</a>, line 174&mdash;'<i>The Turkowit</i>.' This seems to be the name for a lightly-armed
soldier, an archer. This particular knight, we learn later, was captain of Orgelus&eacute;'s
night-watch, or body-guard; his name was Florand of Itolac; and he subsequently marries
Sangiv&eacute;, Gawain's mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_58">58</a>, line 282&mdash;'<i>Tamris and Prisein</i>.' Tamris-Tamarisk, has been mentioned in
Book <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> (p. 242 and Note). Prisein has not been identified, Bartsch suggests Proven&ccedil;al
<i>Bresil</i>.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_58">58</a>, 294&mdash;'<i>The Perilous Ford</i>.' Wolfram's expression here is '<i>Ligweiz prelljus</i>,'
evidently the French '<i>Li guex perelleus</i>.' Chr&ecirc;tien's description of the episode is much
the same, but he represents Gawain as being well acquainted with the character of this
venture, and of the fame that will accrue to the knight who achieves it. In the French
poem there does not appear to be one tree in especial guarded by Guiromelans, but
Gawain is bidden '<i>Quellir de ces flours que ve&eacute;s. A ces arbres et a ces pr&eacute;s.</i>'</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_60">60</a>, line 332&mdash;'<i>King Gramoflanz</i>.' This character has been already referred to
in Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 258. In Chr&ecirc;tien he is called Le Guiromelans, and Wolfram's name for
him is undoubtedly derived from some such original (cf. Appendix B, vol. i.). The
account of his meeting with Gawain differs in many respects in the French version; there
his quarrel with Gawain seems to be much more of a personal matter, not only has
King Lot slain his father, as here, but Gawain himself has slain seven of his kinsmen.
Chr&ecirc;tien's description of the king's dress and appearance is far less gorgeous than is
Wolfram's.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_60">60</a>, line 340&mdash;'<i>Sinzester</i>.' Bartsch suggests that <i>Winchester</i> is here meant. In
Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span> we find Kondrie wearing a hat with plumes of 'the English peacock.'</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_60">60</a>, line 353&mdash;'<i>Eidegast</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">II.</span> p. 39 and Note on '<i>The Tourney</i>.' In
Chr&ecirc;tien Orgelus&eacute;'s lover is not named but he has been slain by Guiromelans, and, as
here, it is her desire for vengeance that has led her to urge Gawain to the venture; but in
the French poem Orgelus&eacute; is a much less imposing personage, and her attempts at
vengeance are of a less organised character.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_61">61</a>, line 374&mdash;'<i>Yet alas! I have ne'er beheld her</i>.' Such instances of a knight
vowing himself to the service of a lady whom he had never seen were by no means rare in
medi&aelig;val times. (Cf. the well-known story of Rudel and the Lady of Tripoli.) In
Chr&ecirc;tien, also, Guiromelans is the lover of Gawain's sister, whose name there is Clarissant.
In the French poem Guiromelans gives a full history of all the queens, here he only states
the identity of Itonj&eacute;, and Gawain apparently takes the rest for granted.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_62">62</a>, line 419&mdash;'<i>L&ouml;ver</i>.' This name has been mentioned in Book <span class="smcap">IV.</span> p. 121. The
derivation is uncertain, but in each instance Arthur's kingdom, as a whole, seems to be
meant. The curious name 'Bems by the Korka' has exercised critics much; Chr&ecirc;tien
has '<i>A Pentecouste est la cors le roi Artu en Orcanie</i>,' and <i>Korka</i> is evidently a form of
Orcanie. Some have suggested that 'Bems bei' is a misunderstanding of Pentecouste
(couste = <i>c&ocirc;te</i>), but the derivation seems far-fetched and unsatisfactory; all that can be
said with certainty is that the name points to a French source.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_62">62</a>, line 425&mdash;'<i>Rosche Sabbin</i>.' This also seems to be derived from the French;
Chr&ecirc;tien calls the castle 'Roche de Sanguin,' and Wolfram seems to have transferred the
name to Gramoflanz' kingdom.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_64">64</a>, line 471&mdash;'<i>True as the one-horned marvel</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 277, where the
story of the Unicorn's love for a pure maiden is given. We learn from this passage that
advantage was taken of its slumber to slay it.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_65">65</a>, line 511&mdash;'<i>For the winning his death</i>.' Here we have a full explanation of
the connection between Orgelus&eacute; and Anfortas. The tent given to the Lady of Logrois
by Anfortas was, we learn from the <i>Willehalm</i> (which abounds in allusions to the <i>Parzival</i>),
sent to that monarch by Queen Sekundill&eacute; as a love-token.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_66">66</a>, line 547&mdash;'<i>And never a man beheld me</i>.' This account of Orgelus&eacute;'s bargain
with the knights who fought for her, and her relations with Parzival and Gawain, throws
a most curious light on the conventionalities of the day. It is quite evident that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>Orgelus&eacute;
in no way transgressed against the code of manners then prevailing, she is throughout
treated as a great lady, and is well received at Court.</p>

<p>Though this is the only episode of the kind recounted, it is quite clear from Books <span class="smcap">XIV.</span>
pp. 130-131 and <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> 173 that Orgelus&eacute; was not the only lady who had proffered her love
to Parzival and been refused. (Those familiar with Wagner's <i>Parzival</i> will not need to have
it pointed out to them what fine dramatic use he has made of the fact that it is Anfortas'
love, and the indirect cause of his wound, who thus offers herself to Parzival. With
wonderful skill Wagner has combined the characters of Kondrie and Orgelus&eacute;, thereby,
in some ways, assimilating Kondrie more closely to the original form of the legend.)</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_69">69</a>, line 625&mdash;'<i>The Swallow</i>.' Bartsch says that this was an English harp, so
called from the fact that the lower part of the frame was shaped like the fork of a
swallow's tail.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_69">69</a>, line 639&mdash;'<i>The Buhurd</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">II.</span> Note on '<i>The Tourney</i>.' There is
no trace of this formal knightly reception in Chr&ecirc;tien,&mdash;there the old queen receives them
seated outside the castle, and the maidens dance and sing around them.</p>

<p>(From this point onwards there is no resemblance between Wolfram's poem and any

<p>Page <a href="#Page_74">74</a>, line 39&mdash;'<i>One lived of yore named Sarant</i>.' Cf. note to Book <span class="smcap">I.</span> '<i>Silk of</i>
<i>Orient</i>.' Bartsch identifies the name of the skilful weaver with that of an Asiatic people,
probably the Chinese. Thasm&eacute; is named later on as part of Feirefis' kingdom. His
battle-cry is 'Tabronit and Thasm&eacute;!' '<i>Akraton</i>,' cf. Book <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> p. 230.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_75">75</a>, line 66&mdash;'<i>Itonj&eacute;</i>.' This is the French name 'Idonie.' In Chr&ecirc;tien the
maiden is named Clarissant, and Gawain wins her confidence in the same manner. Chr&ecirc;tien's
share of the <i>Conte</i> ends so abruptly that we cannot tell how he intended to treat her
love-story; here, it plays a considerable part in the development of the poem.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_77">77</a>, line 147&mdash;'<i>Now the hour it was come</i>.' The account of the feast here given
is very interesting from the light it throws on medi&aelig;val manners and customs. In those
days it was very usual for two to eat from one plate, in fact, this was one of the rules of
the Knights Templars; the reason assigned being that one brother might care for the
other, and all share alike (cf. Feast at Monsalv&auml;sch, Book <span class="smcap">V.</span> p. 136). On great occasions
the principal guests seem to have had ladies assigned to them as their table companions
(cf. Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span> p. 178). One would gather from this passage, and that in Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span>, that the
lady of highest rank had the hostess for companion, thus we find Arniv&eacute; eating with
Orgelus&eacute;, and Guinevere having a queen (probably Ekuba) for companion; while Kunnewaare
is Arthur's table-mate, as here Itonj&eacute; is Gawain's.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_78">78</a>, line 180&mdash;'<i>Ne'er was it night in her presence</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">II.</span> p. 48.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_79">79</a>, line 194&mdash;'<i>Thuringia</i>.' San Marte remarks on this passage that at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
period music and song invariably went together, the one was necessary to the complete
understanding of the other; separately, they were unintelligible. In many instances the
lyrical poems of the day were wedded to dance music, the flowing graceful rhythm of which
made it an appropriate vehicle for the illustration of poetry. The Thuringian Court being
the centre of the literary life of the time many of these dances would naturally originate
there; though it must not be supposed that dances <i>without</i> the accompaniment of song
were not also known.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_81">81</a>, line 262&mdash;'<i>Kancor, and Th&egrave;bit, and Trebuchet</i>.' San Marte says that Th&egrave;bit
is Thabet Ben Korka, a famous Arabic physician, mathematician, and philosopher of the
ninth century. Kancor is probably Kenkeh, an astronomer and physician of the same
period. Trebuchet has been mentioned before. Cf. Book <span class="smcap">V.</span> p. 144 and Note.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_81">81</a>, 279&mdash;'<i>'Twas yet in the early morning</i>.' Chr&ecirc;tien gives no account of the
delivery of the squire's message, but simply states that he finds Arthur and his knights
plunged in grief at the prolonged absence of Gawain, and then breaks off abruptly in the
middle of a sentence before they have learnt of his safety. From this point onward Wolfram's
version is entirely independent of the <i>Conte del Graal</i>, but his poem shows no dislocation
or contradiction, such as one would expect would have been the case had he been
following a source that suddenly failed him; on the contrary, there is a far more complete
harmony between all the parts of Wolfram's poem than we find in any other Romance of
the cycle.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_82">82</a>, lines 301-10&mdash;'<i>Meljanz de Lys</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> p. 239, and Introduction to
Book <span class="smcap">X.</span> and Note. If there was no account of Gawain's intermediate adventures Wolfram
is evidently anxious to make his hearers believe in the existence of such a record, by means
of well-timed and appropriate allusions. The fact that the combat was to be in the
presence of Meljanz de Lys is only casually mentioned in Book <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> For the allusions to
Kunnewaare, Jeschut&eacute;, and Ekuba cf. closing pages of Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span> with the account of the
dispersal of the company at Plimiz&ouml;l. The whole passage is a proof of the care with
which the poem has been constructed, and the details brought into harmony with each
other.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_83">83</a>, line 339&mdash;'<i>Brought he news of some gallant venture?</i>' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span> p. 176
and Note.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_87">87</a>-88, lines 466-506&mdash;'<i>His doings, Sir Knight, I to thee will tell</i>.' This history
of the magician Klingsor, as noted in Book <span class="smcap">X.</span>, is found in Wolfram only, and the indications
seem to point to a <i>French</i> source. Terre de Lab&ucirc;r is undoubtedly a French rendering
of Terra di Lavoro, in Calabria. Kalot Enbolot is Kalota-Belota, a fortress on the
south-eastern coast of Sicily, well known in the days of the Hohenstauffen. This location
of Klingsor's kingdom in Southern Italy may have been introduced in order to lend a
colour to his supposed relationship to Virgil, who by the twelfth century was firmly
established in popular belief as a magician. The name Iblis, Bartsch refers to the
Sicilian town Hybla; Ibert may be a form of the French Guibert. It is difficult to avoid
the conclusion that in the lord of the Ch&acirc;teau Merveil, wounded as a punishment of unlawful
love, we have a parallel to the King of Monsalv&auml;sch, whose wound is due to a
similar cause. (A reference to the original German will show how close this resemblance
is); as mentioned before, it seems to be a parallel, rather than a contrast, which Wolfram
intended to draw between his two heroes. It may well be that in the original version of
the story from which both Chr&ecirc;tien's and Wolfram's poems are derived the Gawain
episodes were unfinished, and that in their original form Gawain, too, was brought to the
Grail Castle, but to regard them as unfinished <i>here</i> seems a clear misunderstanding of the
meaning of the poem. We are distinctly given to understand (p. <a href="#Page_97">97</a>, line 780) that
Gawain's lot in life is finally settled, the Grail Quest, which was originally in the Gawain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
story, has been quietly dropped, and this adventure of the Ch&acirc;teau Merveil has taken its
place; an alteration which artistically can only be considered an improvement, as it clearly
marks Gawain's position as secondary to Parzival. Whether the story of Klingsor was
introduced for the purpose of emphasizing the parallel between Monsalv&auml;sch and Ch&acirc;teau
Merveil it is difficult to say. Certainly, the incident of Parzival's missing the adventure of
the Magic Castle, as he did that of Monsalv&auml;sch, by failing to ask the question must, as
noted above, be due to this idea. With the end of this book Gawain's adventures are
practically concluded; Wolfram promptly clears the stage for the winding-up of the history
of his real hero, Parzival, by bringing the two knights into contact, when Gawain is
naturally worsted, and takes the second place. Whether it be due to Wolfram or to his
source, it is certain that the <i>Parzival</i> is far simpler in construction than the majority of
the Grail Romances, in which the adventures of various heroes succeed each other with
such bewildering rapidity and similarity of incident that it is difficult to tell who is the real
hero of the tale!</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_89">89</a>, line 519&mdash;'<i>A child was born of a mother</i>.' A well-known medi&aelig;val riddle,
which Wolfram might easily have derived from a German source.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_90">90</a>, line 531&mdash;'<i>Of joy had I once full measure</i>.' It is somewhat curious that in
Chr&ecirc;tien Gawain eulogizes <i>Guinevere</i> in similar terms. It rather looks as if the original
passage had been the same in both instances, though it would be difficult to tell to which
queen it originally referred.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_91">91</a>, line 566&mdash;'<i>Maurin</i>.' This name occurs in the <i>Lancelot</i> of Ulrich von Zatzikhoven,
from which it was probably borrowed.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_92">92</a>, line 601 <i>and seq.</i>&mdash;'<i>And either side had suffered</i>.' Garel and Gaherjet: cf.
Note to Book <span class="smcap">XII.</span> Iofreit, son of Idol: cf. Book <span class="smcap">V.</span> p. 155 and Note. Though this
character only plays an unimportant part in the poem, he is yet very frequently mentioned,
it may be that in the original French source he was more prominent. Friam is
probably the same name as Urian, in Book <span class="smcap">X.</span> Vermandois and Nevers point to a French
origin.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_94">94</a>, line 658&mdash;'<i>Save the tent of Eisenhart only</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">I.</span> p. 16 and Note.
Tents seem to have been favourite love-gifts at this time, note the Booth in Books <span class="smcap">XI.</span> and
<span class="smcap">XII.</span> given by Anfortas to Orgelus&eacute;, and, as we know from <i>Willehalm</i>, sent to that king in
the first instance by Sekundill&eacute;.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_96">96</a>, line 733&mdash;'<i>Meljanz of Lys</i>.' How Meljanz of Lys came to be there is not
explained. It is worthy of note that in Book <span class="smcap">VII.</span> we find the King of Lirivoin fighting
against Meljanz, and taken captive by Parzival; <i>here</i> the men of Lirivoin are evidently on
the same side.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_97">97</a>, line 763&mdash;'<i>The wounds of Kay had been healed</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span> p. 169 and
Note to Book <span class="smcap">III.</span></p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_99">99</a>. line 819&mdash;'<i>A knight his bridle drew</i>.' This knight is, of course, Parzival,
though how he came to be there is not explained. In the <i>Conte del Graal</i> Perceval does
not appear on the scene for some time, and passes through a variety of wild and fantastic
adventures before finally winning the Grail. The poem, as we possess it, is more than
twice as long as Wolfram's.</p>

<p>[With reference to the Klingsor and Iblis story, it is noteworthy that Chr&ecirc;tien's
first continuator relates a long story of King Carduel of Nantes and his reputed son
Carados. The wife of King Carduel is beloved by a magician, Garahiet, who is in truth
the father of Carados. The latter grows to manhood and goes to King Arthur's court
to receive knighthood, there a stranger knight appears and offers to allow his head to
be cut off provided the knight who accepts the challenge will submit to the same
ordeal a year later. Carados accepts, and strikes off the head of the knight who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
picks it up and walks off. Returning after a year he finds Carados ready to fulfil his part
of the bargain, and then acquaints him with the fact that he, and not Carduel, is in truth
his father. Carados returns to the court of Carduel and tells him what he has learnt from
the magician; the king in anger imprisons his wife in a tower; she is nevertheless still
visited by her lover, whom the king eventually surprises and punishes in a manner
appropriate to his crime. This story, in its outline, appears to be the basis of the
Klingsor and Iblis episode, but it has been very freely handled by the compiler, and, as
suggested above, not improbably altered so as to draw out the parallel between Klingsor
and Anfortas.</p>

<p>A feature of importance in this connection is that the episode of Carados and his
magician father, a most famous story of the Arthurian cycle, is elsewhere invariably
associated with <i>Gawain</i>; <i>e.g.</i> in the well-known Middle-English poem of 'Sir Gawain
and the Green Knight,' and it is difficult to understand why, in a part of the poem
specially devoted to the adventures of this knight, the French poet should have attributed
this, one of his greatest and most famous feats, to another hero.</p>

<p>Here again we find a parallel in Irish literature; in the 'Fled Bricrend,' Bricriu's
feast, the feat by which Cuchulainn establishes his claim to be regarded as the chief Ulster
hero is precisely this one; though the French poem in making the magician the father of
the hero seems to have retained an archaic trait which has disappeared from the, in point
of redaction, centuries older Irish story. But from other Irish stories we know that
Cuchulainn was the son of a god who is sometimes represented as carrying off the mortal
mother to his fairy home, sometimes as visiting her in animal shape.</p>

<p>The foregoing facts warrant, I think, the conclusion that Gawain originally occupied
in the Brythonic hero-saga of Arthur much the same position as Cuchulainn in the
Goidelic hero-saga of Conchobor, both being par excellence <i>the</i> adventurous hero. Both,
too, it should be noted, are sister's son to the king of the cycle; the same position being
occupied by Diarmaid, <i>the</i> adventurous hero of the Finn or Ossianic cycle.</p>

<p>The nature of the connection between these cycles of romantic legend cannot be dealt
with here. It is sufficient to show that in the French Arthurian poems of the twelfth
century (which in one form or another undoubtedly form the basis of the <i>Parzival</i>) we
have piecings together of originally disconnected narratives about separate heroes, many
of which are found in more archaic form in the stories told of the Irish hero Cuchulainn
and his compeers. In the process of piecing together, adjusting to the genealogical
requirements of the cycle and to the social conceptions and literary modes of the twelfth
century, the early Celtic narratives suffered sadly as far as order and significance are
concerned, though gaining immensely in other respects. The changes are of course
greatest where such far-reaching new ideas as the symbolical representation of Christian
doctrine, or the exemplification of lady-service, affect the original narrative.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Alfred</span>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_103">103</a>, line 13&mdash;'<i>From Monsalv&auml;sch they came, the chargers</i>.' This fact that both
Parzival and Gawain are riding Grail steeds is constantly insisted upon by Wolfram, and
may be intended to emphasise the parallel obviously drawn between the two heroes. It
does not seem very clear why Gawain, who here has nothing to do with Monsalv&auml;sch,
should ride a Grail steed; if Wolfram took over the fact from his French source it may,
perhaps, be a survival of Gawain's original connection with the Grail Castle, which, as
noted above, has been dropped out of the German poem. The history of Gawain's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
charger has been told more than once, cf. Book <span class="smcap">VII.</span> p. 196 and Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 272.
Parzival's horse is, of course, the one ridden by the Grail knight, cf. Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 258.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_104">104</a>, line 38&mdash;'<i>Poinzacleins</i>.' Bartsch considers that the name of this river points
to a French source, and indicates the sloping nature of its banks, the old French word for
which would be <i>aclins</i>, Proven&ccedil;al <i>aclis</i>.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_105">105</a>, line 52&mdash;'<i>Punt, the water-locked city</i>.' <i>Punt</i> = <i>pont</i> = bridge; German <i>Br&uuml;cke</i>
or <i>Br&uuml;gge</i>. The name of this town is decidedly suggestive of <i>Bruges</i>, and considering the
fact that Chr&ecirc;tien confessedly derived his version of the story from a book given to
him by the Count of Flanders, the frequent allusions throughout the poem to men of
'Punturtois' should not be ignored.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_105">105</a>, line 57&mdash;'<i>Count Bernard of Riviers</i>.' A name of undoubtedly French origin.
His father, Count Narant, has been mentioned in Book <span class="smcap">IV.</span> p. 119. Uckerland is probably
a misunderstanding for Outre-land.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_105">105</a>, line 74&mdash;'<i>Ecidemon-woven</i>.' This is a curious passage, as we are distinctly
told in Book <span class="smcap">XV.</span> p. 136 that Ecidemon is an animal; and as such it is named in Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span>
p. 276 among the list of poisonous serpents. As we hear in Book <span class="smcap">XV.</span> p. 136 that
<i>Salamanders</i> wove the robe of Feirefis it is possible that the same power was ascribed to
the Ecidemon. But the passage is somewhat ambiguous, and <i>here</i> a country, and not an
animal, may be meant.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_107">107</a>, line 127 <i>and seq.</i>&mdash;'<i>Killicrates</i>.' This name is of distinctly Greek origin. We
find in Book <span class="smcap">XV.</span> p. 154 that he was King of Centrium (which Bartsch identifies with the
land of the Centaurs), and one of the princes conquered by Feirefis. In the same list of
names we find Kalomedent&eacute; and Ipopotiticon; according to Bartsch the former name is a
compound of K&aacute;lamos, and signifies Reed-land; the latter he suggests may be a variation
of Hyperponticon, the land beyond the Pontus. Agatyrsjent&eacute; may perhaps be the same
as Assigarziont&eacute; mentioned in Book <span class="smcap">XV.</span> p. 136, as famous for its silks. '<i>Akraton</i>,' cf.
Book <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> p. 230.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_108">108</a>, line 150&mdash;'<i>He cast from his hand his weapon</i>.' It is worth remarking how
strongly Wolfram insists on this tie of brotherhood, both of arms, as here, and of blood, as
in Book <span class="smcap">XV.</span> To fight with one closely related by friendship, or one near of kin, is in his eyes
a sin against one's <i>self</i>, one's own personality. Other writers of the cycle do not seem to
consider such a combat, provided it were not to death, in so serious a light. The etiquette
connected with the naming themselves by the knights should be noted; it was the right
of the victor to demand the name of the vanquished. Here, Parzival has heard Gawain's
name from the pages, and therefore makes no objection to revealing himself; in the next
Book when Feirefis asks his name he refuses to give it, the combat between them is
practically undecided, and he will not admit Feirefis's right to put the question. That
Feirefis names himself is an act of courtesy on his part. This unwillingness to name
themselves was probably originally connected with the idea of the identity of <i>name</i> and
<i>person</i>&mdash;once so universal; to this day the superstition that it is unlucky to mention the
name of a person exists among certain races, and circumlocution and nicknames are
employed to avoid the necessity for disclosing the real appellation of the individual
referred to.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_110">110</a>, line 237&mdash;'<i>In wrath spake the lips of Ben&eacute;</i>.' We have already been told in
Book <span class="smcap">X.</span> p. 24, that the Ferryman, Ben&eacute;'s father, was of knightly birth, but it seems strange
to find her addressing so powerful a monarch as King Gramoflanz in such discourteous
terms. As noted before, the character of Ben&eacute; and the part she plays are peculiar to
Wolfram's version, and difficult of explanation.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_113">113</a>, line 325&mdash;'<i>Yet, Sire, when I saw thee last</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span> p. 179, and Book
<span class="smcap">XV.</span> p. 158. Nevertheless, the other knights do not seem in any way to have held Parzival<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
as really dishonoured; they receive and welcome him as one of their body, though he has
<i>not</i> won the Grail, nor, so far, apparently expiated his sin in failing to put the question.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_114">114</a>, line 339&mdash;'<i>He should eat without on the meadow</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">V.</span> p. 154.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_115">115</a>, line 402&mdash;'<i>Did women with wealth o'erburdened</i>,' <i>etc.</i> That gifts of armour
and warlike trappings were usual on the part of the lady is evident from many passages,

<p>Page <a href="#Page_117">117</a>, line 460&mdash;'<i>Affinamus of Clitiers</i>.' This knight has not been named before.
The same name occurs in the list of princes overcome by Feirefis, Book <span class="smcap">XV.</span> p. 154, but it
is evidently a different individual. Bartsch suggests that the name is of Greek origin,
Clitiers being derived from Clitorium.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_117">117</a>, line 467&mdash;'<i>Then out spake King Lot's son gaily</i>.' Cf. p. <a href="#Page_110">110</a>, line 225.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_121">121</a>, line 587&mdash;'<i>Now greeting to whom I owe greeting</i>.' Bartsch remarks that this
love-letter and that addressed by Anflis&eacute; to Gamuret, Book <span class="smcap">II.</span> p. 44, are specially
interesting as being almost the oldest specimens of love-letters in German literature.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_124">124</a>, line 675&mdash;'<i>Beau-corps</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span> p. 183. From the passage on p. <a href="#Page_114">114</a>
it would seem as if Gawain had other brothers, as in most stories of the cycle he has, but
Wolfram mentions none but Beau-corps.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_129">129</a>, line 830 <i>and seq.</i>&mdash;'<i>Arthur gave maid Itonj&eacute;</i>.' It has been suggested that here
Wolfram is indulging in sly mockery at the many weddings which, as a rule, wound up
the medi&aelig;val romances. In the original tales the whole character of King Arthur and his
court was far less stamped with the rigid morality we have learned to associate with them,
and the somewhat indiscriminate promotion of love-affairs and marriages (cf. Book <span class="smcap">XV.</span>
p. 157) is quite in keeping with what we elsewhere read of the king. (See note to Book <span class="smcap">X.</span>
p. 204, for Mr. Nutt's remarks on the marriage of Gawain being celebrated at the Ch&acirc;teau
Merveil, instead of at court.)</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_130">130</a>, line 869&mdash;'<i>But Parzival, he bethought him</i>,' <i>etc.</i> It cannot be too strongly
insisted upon that this presentment of Parzival as a married man, and absolutely faithful
to his wife is quite peculiar to Wolfram's version of the story. Whether it is <i>entirely</i> due
to the German poet we cannot now tell, but we meet with such constant instances of
Wolfram's sense of the sanctity of the marriage vow, and the superiority of lawful, over
unlawful, love, it seems most probable that it is to his genius we owe this, the most
beautiful feature of the story. There is nothing answering to it either in Chr&ecirc;tien or his
continuators, although in Gerbert the hero's successive failures are declared to be due to
his forsaking Blanchefleur.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_135">135</a>, line 22&mdash;'<i>His armour a knight displayed</i>.' The riches of Feirefis and his
costly raiment are dwelt upon at such length that one suspects that the aim of the poet
was to exalt the importance of the House of Anjou; of which Feirefis, rather than Parzival,
must here be considered the representative.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_139">139</a>, line 120&mdash;'<i>My brother and I are one body</i>,' <i>etc.</i> As remarked before, Wolfram
has an extremely high idea of the binding nature of family relationships, cf. Book <span class="smcap">III.</span>
p. 97 and further on p. 145.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_139">139</a>, line 121&mdash;'<i>Asbestos</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 281.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_139">139</a>, line 138&mdash;'Kaukasus.' It is rather curious to find Sekundill&eacute; associated with
Kaukasus, as we are elsewhere told that she was queen of Tribalibot, <i>i.e.</i> India. In Book
<span class="smcap">X.</span> p. 11 we are told that she had golden mountains in her kingdom, which may have
suggested the connection.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_140">140</a>, line 155&mdash;'<i>And the other, the precious jewels</i>,' <i>etc.</i> It has already been
remarked (Note to Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span>) that the attribution of strengthening virtue to precious stones,
and the prominence given to them throughout the poem, is a special feature of the <i>Parzival</i>.
In the next book we meet with a remarkable instance of this peculiarity.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_140">140</a>, line 161&mdash;'<i>Kardeiss and Lohengrin</i>.' This is the first intimation we have of
the existence of Parzival's sons; from Kondrie's speech on p. <a href="#Page_159">159</a>, he seems himself to have
been unaware of their birth. We hear of Parzival sending the knights conquered by him to
yield themselves captives to Kondwiramur (Book <span class="smcap">VII.</span> p. 220 and Book <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> p. 243), and
she, therefore, would be in some degree aware of her husband's movements during the five
years of separation; but we have no indication of his having received any message from
her; and from the wandering life he led during these years (cf. Introduction to Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span>),
and the fact that he had no squire in attendance who could act as go-between, it seems
most probable that Parzival heard nothing of his wife throughout the entire time&mdash;a fact
which makes his fidelity to her even more striking. <i>Kardeiss</i> was doubtless named after
his mother's brother, whose death is referred to in Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span> p. 167. <i>Lohengrin</i>, or as the
name stands in the original, with an additional syllable, <i>Loherangrin</i>, has been derived
from <i>Lothringen</i>, the German form Lorraine. If so, this may indicate the source of the
story of the Swan-knight, which did not, of course, originally belong to the Grail legend.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_140">140</a>, line 170&mdash;'<i>Pelrap&auml;r!</i>' seq. It is very curious that though Wolfram emphasizes
the fact (p. <a href="#Page_139">139</a>) that Parzival had regained his faith in God, yet it is not this faith
which stands him in good stead in the hour of his greatest peril; neither is it his devotion
to the Grail; but it is his loyal love for, and fidelity to, his wife that proves his salvation.
If the aim of the poem were, as some critics contend, a purely religious one, then we should
surely find that at the crucial moment of the hero's career religion, and not <i>Love</i>, would be
the saving power. As it is, Parzival's words to Gawain, Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span> p. 188, are abundantly
borne out, and it <i>is</i> his wife, and no heavenly power, that acts as Guardian Angel. (The
lines 170-71 are not of course to be taken literally, '<i>o'er kingdoms four</i>' is used in other
old German poems as equivalent for '<i>a great distance</i>.' It is not to be supposed that
Kondwiramur was in any sense, even mystically, aware of her husband's danger, though
doubtless it is the conviction that her love for him is as steadfast as his for her that
strengthens his arm.) Throughout this conflict between the two brothers it is love, in the
twelfth century form of <i>Minne-Dienst</i>, which is regarded as the animating power on either
side; though the fact that they are respectively Christian and heathen is insisted on by the
poet, yet we do not find the conflict regarded as a struggle between the two religions, nor
any sign given of the superiority of the God of the Christian to the heathen deities, in fact
the same Divine Power is invoked to shield them both (p. <a href="#Page_139">139</a>). It certainly seems here
as if the <i>knightly</i> interpretation had, in a great measure, overborne the <i>ethical</i>. That
there <i>was</i> an ethical signification attached to the episode seems evident, not only from the
fact that this conflict with Feirefis, whose peculiar parti-coloured appearance recalls so
strongly the contrast between Doubt and Faith, drawn in the Introduction, is the last stage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
in Parzival's long expiation; but also from the fact of the breaking of Ither of Gaheviess'
sword, of which special mention is made in lines 173 and <i>seq.</i> The poet evidently intends
us to regard this as a token that Parzival's youthful sins have been atoned for, and there
seems little doubt that the incident was introduced here for that purpose. That the sword
here broken was originally the <i>Grail</i> sword, and that the change was made by Wolfram
from the difficulty of reconciling that fact with previous statements (cf. Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 252), as
Simrock suggests, is most improbable, there would have been no reason for the <i>Grail Sword</i>
breaking in this rather than in any other combat (accepting Chr&ecirc;tien's statement that the
sword would break only in <i>one peril</i>; it had withstood considerably more than <i>one blow</i>),
quite the contrary, as here Parzival is practically the Grail champion; but there is a deep
significance in this shattering of the last token of the headstrong folly of his youth. It seems
most probable that Wolfram found this incident in his source; and that the original
meaning of the combat was to depict the last desperate struggle of the soul with Doubt,
wherein by <i>steadfast resistance</i> (absolute conquest is not at once to be looked for) the sins
of the past are wiped out, and the soul becomes finally worthy of reward.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_141">141</a>, line 195&mdash;'<i>Thro' fear shall I tell my name?</i>' Cf. Note to Book <span class="smcap">XIV.</span> The
courteous and knightly bearing of Feirefis, both here and on p. <a href="#Page_142">142</a>, should be noted. In
everything but faith he is quite the equal of his Christian brother; indeed it must be admitted
that, compared with either Feirefis or Gawain, <i>Parzival</i> gives the impression of being
a much less courtly and polished figure. His character seems stamped throughout with a
rugged simplicity and directness, quite in keeping with what we are told of his wild and
lonely youth. It is noticeable, too, how very little, comparatively speaking, Parzival says;
though all the speeches put into his mouth have an earnestness and depth of feeling which
we do not find in the much more frequent utterances of Gawain. Wolfram's tolerant
treatment of heathen, generally, has often been a subject of remark by critics; and, with
regard to Feirefis, the number of allusions to him which the <i>Willehalm</i> contains lead one
to the conclusion that this character, in particular, was a favourite with the poet.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_141">141</a>, line 202&mdash;'<i>How shall "Angevin" be thy title?</i>' The reader will probably by
this time have noticed that, King of Anjou as Parzival is, he is never called an Angevin,
but is invariably referred to as a 'Waleis,' his mother's country. It is his <i>mother's</i> kingdoms
of which he has been deprived (cf. Book <span class="smcap">III.</span> pp. 73, 80, 87), and this is really the
first indication we have that he knows himself to be also lord of Anjou. Gamuret is
alluded to, and gives his name as, Gamuret Angevin; Feirefis, is always Feirefis Angevin;
but Parzival, the hero of the story and the real glory of his house, is not an Angevin but
a 'Waleis.' This shows clearly that the <i>Angevin</i> element formed no part of the original
Perceval legend, but that it has been grafted on to a previously existing Celtic basis.</p>

dropped out. It is a curious idea to occur to a man who, like Wolfram, could not write;
and it is also a curious speech to put into the mouth of one who, like Parzival, had been
brought up in the desert, and deprived of the ordinary training due to his rank.</p>

most commonly thus transferred. It is rather curious though to find the mistake made in
a poem so obviously tinged by Oriental influences as the <i>Parzival</i>. Wolfram, too, seems
to have known that the Saracens had other gods, in <i>Willehalm</i> he names as such
Apollo, Mahmet, and Tervigant.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_153">153</a>, line 583 and <i>seq.</i>, page <a href="#Page_154">154</a>, line 615 and <i>seq.</i> The list of kings conquered by
Feirefis and Parzival contain some very perplexing names, the originals of which have
evidently been corrupted in process of transmission from one language to another.
Bartsch, who has devoted considerable time to the study of the proper names in the
<i>Parzival</i>, has endeavoured, with varying success, to identify the majority; and the
following suggestions are taken from his article on the subject, already quoted in Appendix
B, of vol. i.</p>

<p>In the first list, that of the princes conquered by Feirefis, names of Greek origin are of
frequent occurrence; thus Papirus of Trogodjent&eacute;, Bartsch identifies as the king of the
Troglodyt&aelig;; Liddamus of Agripp&eacute; was originally Laodamus of Agrippias; Tinodent, the
island of Tenedos; Milon is, of course, a well-known Greek name, as is Kallicrates, here
Killicrates, Filones of Hiberborticon is the Greek <i>Philon</i>; and it may be taken as a general
rule that all the names ending in <i>on</i>, in this list, may be traced more or less directly to a
Greek source. Possizonjus is a version of Poseidonios (having probably passed through a
Latin medium); Atropfagent&eacute; is the land of the Androphagi, or Anthropophagi; Acheinor
is the Greek <i>Archenor</i>.</p>

<p>In the list of the heroes conquered by Parzival we have, on the contrary, few classical
names; Jeropleis, <i>i.e.</i> Hieropolis, seems to be almost the only example. The majority of
the names appear to be of Romance origin, or at least to have passed through a Romance
source. Thus Mirabel, the name of a place in Southern France, and Serabel, here the
ending <i>bel</i> indicates the French origin; Villegarunz is the Prov. <i>Villagrana</i>; Jovedast of
Arles, a Proven&ccedil;al, proclaims his own nationality.</p>

<p>It is probably no accident that this majority of classical names appear in the first list,
that of Feirefis, since, as noted above, Greeks and Romans alike were classed by the
medi&aelig;val writers as heathens, and they would see nothing incorrect in giving Saracens
classical names, in the same way as they provided them with classical deities.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_154">154</a>, line 608&mdash;'<i>Olympia and Klauditt&eacute;</i>.' Here again we find the names of the
three queens beloved by Feirefis of distinctly classical origin: Klauditt&eacute; being a French
derivation from Claudia. Sekundill&eacute; is the only queen of whom we hear elsewhere, the
other two are mentioned by name only.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_155">155</a>, line 643&mdash;'<i>Heraclius or Hercules</i>.' Heracles was the hero of a German poem
of the twelfth century, which attributes to him a knowledge of the properties of precious
stones. The Alexander here referred to is Alexander the Great; not the lover of
Surdamur, mentioned in Books <span class="smcap">XII.</span> and <span class="smcap">XIV.</span> (cf. note to <span class="smcap">XII.</span>)</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_156">156</a>, line 664&mdash;'<i>Drianthasm&eacute;</i>.' Apparently a combination of Triande and Thasm&eacute;,

borne the badge of the Grail on her first visit (Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span> p. 177); this, her second
appearance, seems to bear more of an official character.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_158">158</a>, line 741&mdash;'<i>Without a kiss</i>.' A kiss was the customary sign and seal of
forgiveness (cf. Book <span class="smcap">V.</span> 151, 152; Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span> 177; Book <span class="smcap">XIV.</span> 129), but Kondrie is fully
aware of her repulsive appearance, and would, therefore, release Parzival from the
fulfilment of a distasteful duty. It must be noted that, throughout the poem, Kondrie is
in no sense represented as a malicious character. Her brother, Malcr&eacute;ature, on the
contrary, seems to have been thoroughly evil-disposed, cf. Book <span class="smcap">X.</span> p. 12.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_159">159</a>, line 767&mdash;'<i>Now rejoice with a humble heart</i>.' Kondrie's announcement to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
Parzival appears, in some points, to be a direct contradiction of what we have already been
told with regard to the promised healing of Anfortas. In Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 278, Trevrezent
distinctly says that the question must be asked on the <i>first</i> night of the visit to the Castle;
that no warning must be previously given; and that <i>if</i> the knight fulfils these conditions,
then, and then only, will he become king of the Grail. Now Parzival apparently
traverses all these conditions, he omits to ask the question on his first visit, he is told of
the sin he has thereby committed, and on this, his second visit, is made well aware of
what is expected of him (cf. lines 774 and <i>seq.</i>), while the Grail announces him as king
<i>before</i> he has asked the question. It is true that no one tells him the exact words in which
he is to put the query, but Parzival is well aware that he is to ask Anfortas the cause of his
anguish, and it scarcely seems likely that the virtue of the question depends upon the
form in which it is put. Are we to consider from Trevrezent's words, Book <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> p. 171, that
Parzival's valour and steadfastness of purpose have wrought a change in the Divine
Counsels, and that the bliss which he had in his folly forfeited is to be granted to him on
his fulfilment of the <i>spirit</i> of the Grail conditions, the fulfilment of the <i>letter</i> being dispensed
with? The question is a perplexing one, and difficult to solve satisfactorily.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_160">160</a>, line 779&mdash;'<i>Seven stars did she name unto him</i>.' The introduction of these
Arabic names is decidedly curious in view of Wolfram's emphatic statement that the origin
of the <i>Parzival</i> was an Arabic <span class="smcap">MS.</span>, though Bartsch remarks that the names in question
were not necessarily derived from the source, there being still extant a German astronomical
poem of the twelfth century which contains a number of Arabic names. Still it is strange
that Wolfram's version should be as close as it is to the original form of the words, thus
Zev&acirc;l is the Arabic <i>Zuhal</i>, Saturn; Almustri, <i>El-musteri</i>, Jupiter; Almaret, <i>El-mirr&ecirc;k</i>,
Mars; Samsi, <i>Shams</i>, the Sun; Alligafir and Alkamer cannot be exactly identified
with the remaining two planets, Venus and Mercury, but seem to represent rather the
names of two constellations, respectively called El-gafir and El-kidr. Alkamer is the
moon, Arabic <i>El-kamer</i>.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_160">160</a>, line 799&mdash;'<i>If thou speakest, Lady</i>.' The humility of this speech of Parzival's,
contrasted with the indignant outbreak of wounded pride in Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span> pp. 187, 188, is the
most decisive proof which the poem affords of the spiritual change which has passed over
him, and of his fitness to become king of the Grail, a blessing which Anfortas has forfeited
through lack of humility (cf. Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 272 and Book <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> p. 182).</p>

<h3>BOOK XVI</h3>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_165">165</a>, line 5, <i>and seq.</i>&mdash;'<i>Then he spake to the knights of Monsalv&auml;sch</i>.' Those
readers who are familiar with Wagner's <i>Parzival</i> will see in this speech of Anfortas to
the knights, and his attempt to win death for himself by shutting his eyes to the Grail, the
germ of the scene in the Grail Temple in Act III. of the Drama. It will be noted that
<i>here</i> Anfortas does not injure any one but himself by this attempt at self-destruction.
Titurel is still alive, cf. p. <a href="#Page_178">178</a>. It is noteworthy that the knights still await the advent of
the promised Healer; though, as we gather from Trevrezent's speech, Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 278,
'The knight, he hath come, and hath left us,' they were aware that <i>Parzival</i> was he, and
had failed to fulfil his mission.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_167">167</a>, line 67, <i>and seq.</i>&mdash;'<i>Carbuncle and Balas ruby</i>,' <i>etc.</i> It has before been
remarked that the belief in the virtue of precious stones was very real and very general
in the Middle Ages. Similar lists are given by various writers, Albertus Magnus among
them; and San Marte remarks that, if this list is compared with medi&aelig;val writings, it will
be found that the names have not been put together in a haphazard fashion, but that the
special virtue ascribed to each stone has a direct bearing on Anfortas' sufferings. <i>Jewels</i>, in
the strict sense of the term, these stones are not exclusively, <i>e.g.</i> we find Asbestos and
Pyrites among the list; the expression 'precious stones' was freely construed in those
days. The Latin equivalent of all these names can be found in writings of the period,
but it would scarcely be interesting to give a minute description and identification.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_169">169</a>, line 119&mdash;'<i>And e'en as was there the custom</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">V.</span> p. 132.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_169">169</a>, line 130&mdash;'<i>O'er-long have I waited</i>.' Anfortas' speech to Parzival is curious;
some critics have opined that he alone was not aware of the lately read Grail writing,
and of Parzival's election to the Grail kingdom, and was, therefore, in doubt as to
whether or not he was the destined Deliverer. But, if that were the case, how did he come
not only to know Parzival's name, but to lay such stress upon it ('If <i>Parzival</i> men shall
call thee, <i>then</i>, etc.'), <i>i.e.</i> 'If thou art indeed the chosen ruler of these knights, then
exercise thine authority on my behalf.' We learn from Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 271, that the <i>name</i> of
the elect knights appeared on the Grail. If Anfortas had learnt it from Trevrezent, the
only other source of information he could have had, he would have had no doubt of the
identity of the promised Deliverer with the knight who had already paid an abortive visit to
the Castle; as it is, he recognises him at once, but is in doubt whether he is the
'Parzival' named by the Grail. The meaning of his speech seems to be that Anfortas
was unaware how far Parzival himself was acquainted with the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> assigned to him, and
feared to transgress the Grail's commandment, and risk the promised healing by saying
too much.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_169">169</a>, line 141&mdash;'<i>Now say where the Grail It lieth?</i>' It is remarkable that though
Parzival is well aware of the nature of the question which he is to put to Anfortas, and of
the happy results which will follow (p. <a href="#Page_159">159</a>), yet he fully realises that this healing can only
be brought about by the blessing of God; it is as God's Messenger, and not in his own
power, that he speaks. He feels himself, and wishes the knights to regard him, merely
as the instrument in God's hand; there is no trace of self-assertion or presumption in his
action, the grace of humility has been fully won. The beautiful touch in lines 155-56
seems to show that to Anfortas, also, the long ordeal issued in distinct spiritual gain. It
is worth noting that, from this point onwards, Anfortas is spoken of as a knight in the
prime of life, worthy to be compared in skill and prowess with his nephew, Parzival, and
excelling him in physical beauty; whereas Trevrezent, who was considerably the younger
(cf. Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 275), is always spoken of as an old man. This is, of course, due to the
youth-preserving powers of the Grail (cf. Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 270), so R&eacute;panse-de-Schoie, who
had been in the service of the Grail from her childhood, would have retained the appearance
of a young girl, and there is nothing surprising, therefore, in Feirefis becoming
enamoured of her beauty.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_178">178</a>, line 147&mdash;'<i>By the mouth of His saint, Sylvester</i>.' An allusion to a well-known
story told of S. Sylvester; how when he was defending Christianity against a Jew,
in the presence of the Emperor Constantine, he restored to life, by the invocation of Christ,
a steer which the Jew had slain by whispering the most Holy Name into its ear, but had
failed to revivify by the same means.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_170">170</a>, line 168&mdash;'<i>The wood when they fought of old</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">VI.</span> p. 160 and <i>seq.</i>
This reunion of Parzival and Kondwiramur on the very spot where he had been over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>come
by the mystic love-trance is a most poetical feature of Wolfram's version, and
one found nowhere else.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_171">171</a>, line 183&mdash;'<i>Greater marvel I ne'er may see</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 267. This
passage, with its practical unsaying of much that Trevrezent has said in Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span>, is
extremely difficult of explanation. That there is a distinct discrepancy, not to say contradiction,
between the statements of Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> and those of Book <span class="smcap">XVI.</span> is undoubtedly the
fact; the most probable solution appears to be that suggested in Excursus C at p. <a href="#Page_194">194</a>
of this volume; <i>i.e.</i> the original interpretation, that of Kiot, was purely religious, and it
was that which Wolfram in Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> was mainly following; he himself, however, had
grafted another meaning on to that originally suggested, that of salvation by fidelity to the
knightly ideal, the power of the <i>unverzagter mannes muot</i>. By the time Wolfram had
reached the end of the poem, he found that his interpretation had dominated that of
Kiot, he had practically made Parzival do that which Trevrezent says is impossible
('Wouldst thou force thy God with thine anger?' Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 267. 'Thou by thy wrath
hast won blessing'), and this passage seems to be an attempt to harmonise these two
conflicting ideas. It is certainly not easy of interpretation, for on the face of it, while
Trevrezent is asserting the unchanging nature of God's decrees, as illustrated by the
history of the rebel angels, he is also implying that Parzival himself has been the object
of special and peculiar favour on the part of the Deity, and that the foreordained course
of events has in his case been at least modified.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_172">172</a>, line 213&mdash;'<i>Duke Kiot of Katelangen</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">IV.</span> p. 107, and Book
<span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 274.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_174">174</a>, line 277&mdash;'<i>When many a year had flown</i>.' This is the only indication we
have of the eventual recovery of Parzival's inheritance. From the emphasis laid upon the
episode in Book <span class="smcap">III.</span> one would have expected to find Parzival himself making some effort
for the recovery of his kingdoms, but he never seems to have done so (cf. Notes to Book
<span class="smcap">III.</span> pp. 308, 309).</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_174">174</a>, line 302&mdash;'<i>Schoysian&eacute;, the dead maid's mother</i>.' In Wolfram's poem,
<i>Titurel</i>, we find exactly the reverse of this statement; <i>i.e.</i> Sigun&eacute;, whose mother died at
her birth (as we are repeatedly told), was given into the care of the mother of Kondwiramur,
and the two children were brought up together till Sigun&eacute; was five years old, when
Herzeleide persuaded Duke Kiot to transfer his daughter to her charge. How this
discrepancy arose is not clear; Wolfram may perhaps have forgotten what he had said in
<i>Titurel</i>, or he may have followed his French source.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_174">174</a>. line 306&mdash;'<i>Nor my tale like the bow shall be bended</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">V.</span> p. 137.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_175">175</a>, line 319&mdash;'<i>Garschiloie of Greenland</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">V.</span> p. 144. Greenland here
is not to be understood as the Greenland we know, but as part of Norway. The Grail
maidens have not been individually named before, though the Countess of Tenabroc and
the daughter of Jernis were mentioned in Book <span class="smcap">V.</span> pp. 133, 134. Florie of L&uuml;nel may
be the daughter of the Count of <i>Nonel</i> named in conjunction with Jernis.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_177">177</a>, line 373&mdash;'<i>Claret, Morass, or Sinopel</i>.' Morass seems to have been a wine
made from mulberries; Sinopel, wine mixed with sweet syrups.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_178">178</a>, line 411&mdash;'<i>The Tourney hath fashions five</i>.' Cf. Note to Book <span class="smcap">II.</span> 'The
Tourney.'</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_178">178</a>, line 434&mdash;'<i>If he be a heathen</i>.' This inability of the unbaptized to behold
the Grail, and the renewal of the power of the stone every Good Friday are the two most
direct proofs of the Christian nature of the Talisman to be found in the poem. As
remarked in Note to Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span>, Wolfram never seems really to connect the Grail with the
Passion of our Lord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_179">179</a>, line 441&mdash;'<i>If I, for your sake, be baptiz&egrave;d</i>.' It should be noted that Feirefis is
not in the least influenced by any religious motive in seeking Baptism; throughout, as in
the combat with Parzival in Book <span class="smcap">XV.</span>, it is <i>Love</i> that is his guiding impulse.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_181">181</a>, line 501&mdash;'<i>God is Man</i>,' <i>etc.</i> Cf. p. <a href="#Page_171">171</a> where Trevrezent makes use of
exactly the same words.</p>

lines are inscribed on the fountain erected in 1860 to the memory of the poet, in the
market-place of Ober-Eschenbach.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_182">182</a>, line 526&mdash;'<i>The Templar whom God henceforward</i>.' In the face of the
antiquity of the Swan-knight legend, it is impossible to regard this as more than an
ingenious attempt on the part either of Wolfram or of his French authority to account
for Lohengrin's prohibition of the question, cf. Note on 'Lohengrin.'</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_183">183</a>, line 562&mdash;'<i>Anfortas, he sent a message</i>.' Cf. Book <span class="smcap">IX.</span> p. 285.</p>

and Note.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_183">183</a>, line 580&mdash;'<i>Camelot</i>.' This is the only mention in this poem of the town so
well known in other versions of the Arthurian legend.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_184">184</a>, line 589&mdash;'<i>Prester John</i>.' The belief in a Christian kingdom in the East,
ruled over by a king who was at the same time a priest was very widely spread in the
Middle Ages, but it is very curious to find it thus connected with the Grail legend.
Simrock takes this connection to be a confirmation of his theory, that the Grail myth was
originally closely connected with St. John the Baptist. According to <i>Der j&uuml;ngere Titurel</i>,
a poem which, professedly written by Wolfram and long supposed to be his, is now
known to be the work of a certain Albert von Scharffenburg, the Grail with its guardians,
Parzival, Lohengrin, Kondwiramur, and all the Templars, eventually left Monsalv&auml;sch,
and found a home in the domains of Prester John, but the story seems to be due rather to
the imagination of the writer than to any real legendary source.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_184">184</a>, line 610, <i>and seq.</i>&mdash;'<i>The Lohengrin myth</i>.' This legend of a supernatural
benefactor or deliverer, who arrives at the land which he is to benefit in a boat,
miraculously guided, and leaves it in the same way, is extremely widely spread, and may
be regarded rather as the property of the Aryan race as a whole, than of one nation in
particular. In its earliest forms, such as the legend of Sceaf among the Anglo-Saxons,
and H&ouml;ni in the Faroe Isles, the hero is undoubtedly of divine origin, and the second of
these seems to be the first in which the swan element is introduced. The original signification
appears to be that of a 'year-myth,' symbolising the conflict between the seasons; the
god of spring first overcoming, and then in his turn being overcome by, the power of
winter. Bloete, in an article on the subject in the <i>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Deutsches Alterthum</i>,
explains the connection with the swan by the fact that this is a migratory bird, and that
in the days when the lower part of the Rhine formed a marshy Delta, swans frequented
these lowlands in large numbers on their way to, and from, their summer quarters in
Northern Europe. In this way the birds were the heralds alike of the coming and of
the departing light and warmth, and became associated with the embodied genius of
spring and summer. It is certainly a curious fact that the legend of the Swan-knight
in its developed form is distinctly to be traced to these countries. The original association
with the god of light, Bloete thinks, was the work of Keltic fancy, and by them imparted to
their Batavian successors in the lowlands of the Rhine. By the thirteenth century, the
story had clothed itself in distinctly chivalric form, the hero was no longer a god, but
a knight, and in this shape the legend became connected with the origin of more than one
noble family of the day; notably with that of Godfrey de Bouillon, the Crusader. It
is noticeable in this connection that Gerbert, one of the continuators of Chr&ecirc;tien, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
a passage prophesying that of Perceval's race shall spring the 'Swan-knight and the
Deliverer of the Holy Sepulchre.'</p>

<p>This passage, together with the fact that Wolfram connects Lohengrin with Brabant,
seems to indicate that the German poet was not the first to connect the legend of the
Swan-knight with that of the Grail, but found the story in his French source; though he
certainly gives the earliest version of the legend in the shape in which, through Wagner's
<i>Lohengrin</i>, it is familiar to us to-day. A more prolonged and elaborate account of
Lohengrin's adventures is given in <i>Der j&uuml;ngere Titurel</i> already referred to; here the lady
is the Duchess of Lizaborye, and the catastrophe is brought about by the advice of a
treacherous maid, who persuades the Duchess that if she cuts off, roasts, and eats a
portion of her husband's flesh, he will be unable to leave her. In pursuance of this
intention, armed knights break into Lohengrin's chamber at night, and in the struggle
with them, though overcoming his assailants, he is himself slain. The unhappy wife dies
of grief, and the name of the country is changed from Lizaborye to Lothringen (Lorraine)
in memory of Lohengrin. (Those familiar with the Wagner Drama will note the skill
with which Wagner has combined these two versions of the legend.)</p>

<p>In the forbidden question we probably have a surviving testimony to the originally divine
nature of the hero; it is a well-known feature of such legends that a mortal wife wedded
to a divine husband may not inquire too closely into that husband's nature, <i>e.g.</i> the
myths of Jupiter and Semele, and of Eros and Psyche. The question therefore probably
belongs to the original form of the story, and the passage on p. <a href="#Page_182">182</a> is merely, as suggested
above, an ingenious attempt to explain a feature which puzzled the later compilers.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_186">186</a>, line 661&mdash;'<i>Here Herr Erec should speak</i>.' An allusion to Hartmann's <i>Erec</i>,
so often referred to. The hero forbids his wife to speak to him, she breaks the silence
in order to warn him of an impending danger, and is punished by him for so doing.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_186">186</a>, line 663&mdash;'<i>If Chr&ecirc;tien of Troyes</i>,' <i>etc.</i> Here for the first time Wolfram gives
us clearly to understand that he knew Chr&ecirc;tien's Grail poem, but deliberately preferred to
follow Kiot's' version, to which he has made frequent allusions. If Wolfram's statement
is to be accepted as it stands, we must perforce conclude that both the first two books
and the last three (of which Chr&ecirc;tien has no trace) were in Kiot's poem, '<i>To the end</i>, the
Proven&ccedil;al told it.' Certainly Wolfram himself does not wish us to consider that any part
of the tale was due to his own invention, but rather that he was throughout faithfully
adhering to lines already laid down. The question of the connection between Chr&ecirc;tien
and Wolfram will be found fully discussed in Excursus B.</p>

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
